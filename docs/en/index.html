<h1 id="preface">Preface</h1>
<p>This book has come about because having written a book on iOS Crash Dump Analysis, I found that most of my audience were security-focussed engineers.</p>
<p>I share the same passion. I have been studying various “Crack Me” challenges. I thought I was doing the correct preparation for vulnerability analysis.</p>
<p>When I looked at successful exploits, mostly on Google Project Zero <span class="citation" data-cites="gpz">(Google 2021)</span>, I found there was a technique gap. Not only do you need to apply standard techniques, you need to apply them on unfamiliar APIs, such as <code>IOSurface</code> and <code>XPC</code>. So I naturally looked at Crack Me challenges using those APIs. I wasn’t able to find any.</p>
<p>What I am attempting to do is to document my journey in acquiring the skills to find Zero Day Vulnerabilities on iOS in the form of a book. That is so that future engineers will have a book to take them along the same journey.</p>
<p>So the nature of this book is mostly a tutorial but with appropriate theory explanations or system knowledge explained along the way.</p>
<p>I take the view that when you are exploring new things, cost barriers are magnified because you are not sure at the time whether you will stick with it or enjoy it. Paying a lot of money for golf clubs is a straightforward choice if you’ve already fallen in love with the game. So I am going to work on the basis the reader has modest resources to hand (compared to the professionals in this area). I assume you have an iDevice, a Mac, an Xcode developer account, and maybe software, free or licensed at modest cost.</p>
<p>There is one last element I intend to add to the mix. The Hacker Mentality. This is the attitude of mind where an innocent piece of information can be viewed through a hacker’s lens. That offers the foothold for us to commence experimentation and discovery that then later will result in new vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>If I am successful, I hope this book will become the handbook of vulnerability craftsmanship in the same way that Code Complete <span class="citation" data-cites="codecomplete2">(McConnell 2004)</span> became the handbook of software craftsmanship.</p>
<p>One thing in particular that attracts me to iOS is that its one of the hardest platforms to circumvent. It may turn out I don’t reach the high bar needed to make progress on this platform. But if it was going to be easy, what would be the point in trying?</p>
<h1 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h1>
<p>I’d like to acknowledge the help and support of my colleagues for writing this book.</p>
<p>I am indebted to the support of my Chinese-language translator, TBC, for helping bring the Chinese edition of the book into fruition.</p>
<p>Putting together this work was only possible because it was built upon generously provided open source tools, in particular <code>pandoc</code> which made writing the text of the book a pleasure.</p>
<p>Lastly, I’d like to thank my supportive family whilst I was locked in my study, and largely absent. Thank you Junghyun, and Christopher.</p>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This is a book about Zero Day Vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>It is called “The Road to Zero” because it is primarily a tutorial guide to take you along the path needed to find your own vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>The focus of our book is iOS. In fact, when we talk about iOS we often mean the family of Operating Systems from Apple that are based around the same underpinnings. It would be more accurate to say this book focusses on Darwin, the common UNIX and NeXT technology stack from which macOS, iOS, tvOS, watchOS are derived.</p>
<p>Likewise when we refer to a device, we say iDevice because there are lots of different Apple produced products in different device classes, such as various models of iPhone, or iPad.</p>
<h1 id="zero-day">Zero Day</h1>
<h2 id="what-is-a-zero-day">What is a Zero Day?</h2>
<p>A Zero Day Vulnerability is a security vulnerability which is not yet known to the vendor responsible for the platform that has the vulnerability. Once notified, the “day” value increases each day regardless of the action the vendor does. So a 300-Day vulnerability is one that has been reported to the vendor 300 days ago. It might have been patched on day 30. It might have been patched on day 90. It might never be patched. Even if it has been patched, a vulnerability disclosed 300 days ago is still a 300-Day vulnerability.</p>
<p>As soon as a piece of software (it could also be firmware, a configuration file, resource file, etc.) is written the opportunity for a vulnerability arises. It could be that no one ever discovers the problem. Of the set of vulnerabilities that exist, some are found by humans (or their tools). At that point there is an asymmetry between those that know about the problem and those that do not know about the problem. Such knowledge can be valuable. That knowledge is sometimes traded, sold, or shared. Other times it is kept secret. It is only when the vendor is told about the vulnerability, that the bug is no longer a Zero Day Vulnerability. The date of disclosure then governs the “day” of the vulnerability.</p>
<h2 id="bug-bounty-programmes">Bug Bounty Programmes</h2>
<p>In order to encourage disclosure of vulnerabilities, vendors sometimes have a bug bounty program. They can reward researchers with money, or a promise to contribute to a charity, or with fame by acknowledging them as finding the vulnerability. Since researchers sometimes hoard vulnerabilities so that can do further research unlocked by them, platform owners have responded by giving vetted researchers enhanced access. In particular, Apple has introduced the Security Research Device programme.</p>
<h2 id="market-dynamics">Market Dynamics</h2>
<p>Sometimes multiple groups of engineers working separately find the same Zero Day. Sometimes a researcher suspects a bunch of related Zero Days, but only fully documents one. Likewise, sometimes the vendor only strictly fixes the vulnerability reported, and leaves adjacent issues as untreated. That in turn creates a dynamic in the market where recent bug fix releases are scanned for security fixes by researchers, so that adjacent issues can be explored.</p>
<p>As the stock of vulnerabilities has increased over time, organisations have sought to organize and catalog such findings. This gives insights on the kinds of things that can go wrong. Vendors will improve their game by adding mitigations, which in turn will be researched for weaknesses. So it is a cat-and-mouse game, getting ever more sophisticated.</p>
<p>If we consider “The Road to Zero” in dollar terms, where the dollar amount is the equipment cost, human time cost, etc. to achieve a 0-day, we can think of this book as a stepping stone. Firstly there is the cost to acquiring basic skills. Then there is the cost to acquiring similar skills but on iOS (Darwin) code bases. This book reduces that cost. Finally, there is the cost of finding original 0-days in iOS itself. We effectively make that final step cheaper because our skills have improved via the earlier steps.</p>
<h2 id="market-evolution">Market Evolution</h2>
<p>The market dynamics for iOS 0-day vulnerabilities has changed over time due to the changing nature of the Threat Model that Apple face, and the changing role iPhones and other devices have in our lives. Originally the iPhone had no third party apps. There were two main threats the system had to model. First were the Jailbreak community who wanted to customise the iPhone experience and add their own apps. Second were those that wanted to Carrier-unlock their phone. The phone price would typically be subsidized by the telecommunications operator via a subscription to their network over a period of time before you were allowed to buy a subscription to another operator. With such a threat model, a simple layer of defense was needed. Apple introduced the iPhone App Store, together with sandboxed apps, requiring code-signing for installation for all third party apps. In those days, a vulnerability alone was enough to defeat the security of the phone. So finding and exploiting a 0-day was “most of the game.”</p>
<p>Over the ensuing years, Apple would increase the depth of their defenses with new security measures, but bug hunters could keep up. However, the nature of the market changed. As there became more apps, and everyday work flows became connected to, and supported by, mobile phone apps, the value of the information in your phone drew the interest of government entities, criminals, and law-enforcement, as well as “friends” and family. Now the threat model is diverse and profound. The phone must resist attack when in physical possession of an attacker (such as a phone stolen after a crime). It must resist attack wirelessly when in a hostile network environment, such as an international conference hosting a politicaly sensitive agenda, or an innocent trip to a coffee shop. It must resist attack from a curious partner, grandparent or child.</p>
<p>Since iDevices now have many layers of security, it is not one 0-day alone that unlock deeper access to the system. There are chains of vulnerabilities that need to be exploited to fully attack the system. Each subsystem has become a complex entity. So the market is now one of specialization. One person might be expert in WebKit vulnerabilities. One person might be expert in PDF file format weaknesses. One person might now how to construct “gadgets” to achieve a desired control flow path. There are companies that buy up individual vulnerabilities and assemble them. They might leverage toolkits from others for post-exploitation, etc.</p>
<p>No one person is an industry. We are small players in a complex dynamic market. So it is important to understand what our goals are, what skills we have or desire, and how we see ourselves in this bigger picture.</p>
<h2 id="monetary-rewards">Monetary Rewards</h2>
<p>As the skill requirements have increased, together with increased specialization, the monetary cost of “doing business” has increased. This places security researchers in a novel “taxation” dynamic <span class="citation" data-cites="offensiveworklovehate">(Dullien 2021)</span>. Apple will improve their security. Offensive security companies will need more money to crack into the iDevices as their exploit chains will become longer and more esoteric. They will need to buy in exploits, research material, and hire from a small pool of talent to do the equivalent in-house. Such companies will demand higher fees for their tools, and their solutions will have shorter lifetimes. Law enforcement, military and government entities will need to pay more for such tools. The pressure release value is at the political level. Either politicians agree to allowing strong protections in consumer devices, iPhone chiefly among them. This means taxation on the population (or a re-allocation of funds) to pay the offensive companies more money, and more often, for valuable access to mobile phone information. Or on the other hand, politicians can espouse back-doors into consumer devices. This lowers the “taxation” but increases malicious activity from adversaries.</p>
<p>This explains our current surreal state of affairs. A vulnerabilty can be worth millions, because it is a tax on millions on users that require confidentiality, security and privacy.</p>
<h2 id="ethics">Ethics</h2>
<p>There are a lot of ethical consideration surrounding Zero Day Vulnerabilities (hereafter we shall say 0-day). The consensus is that you should not openly discuss or explain vulnerabilities until the bug is 90 days since disclosure (i.e. a 90-day). So we don’t place 0-days in this text. But we create software modules of our own, reachable from a non-compromised device. These modules emulate closely the properties of an exposed subsystem so we can discuss, explore and compromise “our own code.” We also discuss past vulnerabilities that have been patched by Apple.</p>
<p>Will this book lead to a proliferation of 0-days? My opinion is that the malicious actors already have the tools and knowledge they need. It is the wider engineering community that need to up-skill in this area. Most of these people will not be malicious. They will enhance and improve the security of systems.</p>
<p>In truth, we often tell ourselves stories that make us comfortable with what we are doing, particularly if our pay-cheque aligns with that. The best of intentions can result in adverse outcomes, as well as the converse. For example, a researcher working on their PhD might see a bug class, but just have time to explore one fully, writing up a Proof of Concept (POC), which is duly responsibly disclosed, and patched, before being published as a finding by the researcher. Another engineer might read the write-up, look at the binary diff related to the fix, notice associated vulnerabilities, and produce a variant POC and sell that to a market place for significant money. At that point, the vulnerability could be combined with others and militarized. The question is then who made that weapon, and would it have come to existence anyway? Such a weapon could be used to save lives, lose lives, start conflict or avoid conflict depending on the circumstances politically.</p>
<h2 id="arent-security-bugs-just-bugs">Aren’t security bugs just bugs?</h2>
<p>To take the opposite tack, we can ask ourselves, “Aren’t security bugs just bugs?” In other words, why dwell on 0-days as something special. They are just bugs that can turn out to affect users when exploitable. But lots of things can affect users.</p>
<p>To move forwards with the debate we need to be honest with ourselves. We need to understand our own perspective and agenda. If your goal is to learn how to find and discover 0-days, the process of discovery itself is the joy we seek. If that bug gets an associated vulnerability number, known as a CVE number, then it is a recognition of achievement, much the same as any other professional recognition.</p>
<p>We do have to acknowledge the larger context. Platform owners know that in a large system, there will be bugs, and a subset of those will affect security. The vendor will know that part of their responsibility is patching the bugs when they have been reported. Their wider responsibility is to have processes that avoid the same issue appearing in the future, and avoid the same bug classes appearing. They may change their audit procedure, hire staff to search for bugs, provide training on secure programming practices, perform threat modelling sessions, etc. One fruitful area is applying mitigation layers. The platform may have checks against stack overflows, or malicious changes to control flow integrity, etc. These will be discussed later. In practice, these are powerful weapons.</p>
<p>The ultimate perspective is that of an end-user. Users want to go about their business with the minimal amount of cost, and inconvenience, whilst having a rich and enjoyable user experience. A secure system which is so cumbersome that there are few users does little to help society.</p>
<p>Users need psychological safety, and trust in their systems. A small drop of poison in a large reservoir wouldn’t kill a person, but who would drink water from that reservoir? Security delivers safety and trust.</p>
<p>So security bugs are important, but not special. They are important because over time platform vendors will develop mitigation layers to sweep away the exploitability of 0-days. And the platform vendors that do this in a way that minimises the cost and inconvenience to users will win over the greater number of users. This means that end users will live in a digital world that provides security and trust. And trust is essential to our modern day living.</p>
<p>When we use public transit systems, we trust the safety of the transport system. When we stop by a coffee shop and order a drink, we assume the water in the drink is safe. Wealth is created by a division of labor with individuals doing specialist roles. Such a society can only function when those services are trustworthy. Computing services, such as mobile phone systems and apps are a key service that technologists contribute to the wider society.</p>
<p>Going back to the example of public transit. When sitting on a train, we can often see a couple of people drinking coffee. But we can see plausibly a majority looking at their mobile phone screens. We need the train to be safe, the coffee to be safe, and the mobile computing experience to be safe!</p>
<h2 id="burn-out">Burn Out</h2>
<p>We haven’t even started yet, and so why are we bringing up the topic of burn out?</p>
<p>When you start training your mind to think like a machine thinks, or start working through the details of a subsystem in great deal, it can be both engaging and exhausting. After a period of youthful exuberance can be a down hill descent of despair when you can nearly solve something, but cannot quite get it done.</p>
<p>As ever, there is a way to hack around such problems!</p>
<h3 id="looking-after-the-body">Looking after the body</h3>
<p>First, the boring stuff. Solid, regular and good-quality sleep. Three good meals a day. 30 minutes exercise a day - a good walk for example. These are the basics for maintaining your health. At least for now, humans are not machines, and humans need this basic level of care.</p>
<h3 id="optimizing-the-mind">Optimizing the mind</h3>
<p>Second, the mind hack. That first hour of the day, maybe the first half hour is the golden time. Save the heaviest and most difficult mental task to only that dream slot. Leave the manual, boring and tedious investigation work to the end of your work day. Everything else sits in-between those two things.</p>
<h3 id="smoothing-the-ups-and-downs">Smoothing the ups and downs</h3>
<p>Third, the multi-tasking hack. If security research is the only thing you are doing, then yes you have focus but you are going to have ups and downs. The way around that is to have two activities that vary in importance over a period of months but are a constant presence. One good parallel activity is software engineering. You could be writing a security tool, for example, or something unrelated. Software engineering is in some ways the opposite of vulnerability research. It is building abstractions, adding layers, and working in a problem domain instead of the machine domain. It feels very constructive and creative. Sometimes you make great progress on your software, and other times you make progress on your vulnerability research. Since time away from one task does not stop your mind from advancing it in your mind in the background, the net effect is that when you’re done with vulnerability research, the software engineering seems to go great due to pent up ideas you’ve been working on in the background. The converse applies also, so that after a period of development on your software project, new ideas appear to help advance your security research.</p>
<h3 id="using-version-control-to-contain-complexity">Using version control to contain complexity</h3>
<p>The fourth hack is facilitated by the git version control system. Everything you do must be recorded and tracked with git (or another version control system). Because with git, you can make small incremental improvements (git commits), and then build on those. This provides head space you need to achieve complex things. You just keep incrementally developing your ideas, code, and experiments. Do not try and keep complexity in your mind for a long period. Just keep dumping them into text files, code, etc., into a git repository. Then at the end of each day, you will feel that you made progress, even if there is no big result. That will save your sanity.</p>
<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>
<p>To complement the book, there is a website of resources which is intended to be used alongside the printed material so example projects can be setup and run by yourself and experimented with. All references in this book are collected into the Bibliography Chapter at the end of the book. There you will find URLs to resources, for example.</p>
<p>The GitHub website supporting the book is at <span class="citation" data-cites="trtzgithub">(Memon 2021)</span></p>
<h1 id="the-hammer">The Hammer</h1>
<p>When studying past exploits it can feel like your brain has been hit by a hammer. It is because most exploit discussions work on the basis that you have had an apprenticeship on all the underlying techniques, and that only that final layer needs explanation.</p>
<p>This approach is understandable from the writer’s perspective. If you are a researcher you will naturally seek out underlying technologies, documentation and reading materials as part of your research journey. The writer’s audience will be such researchers. So the writer will not dwell on the supporting techniques and technologies.</p>
<p>Since iOS and macOS use many niche technologies, or use standard techniques with some Apple ecosystem unique twists, it is not so easy to do your background reading.</p>
<p>In this chapter we shall look at an exploit write-up. Our purpose is not to understand the exploit as such, but to survey the techniques and technologies at play. It will provide us the motivation to explore such items in subsequent chapters knowing that this knowledge will then help us circle back and understand the originally presented exploit.</p>
<h2 id="getting-exploits">Getting Exploits</h2>
<p>Exploits can be downloaded from the Exploit Database <span class="citation" data-cites="exploitdb">(Security 2021)</span>. This is a valuable resource and one we shall often refer to. The exploit database has a search tool, <code>searchsploit</code>. If we install <code>searchsploit</code> from <span class="citation" data-cites="exploitdb">(Security 2021)</span> and configure our <code>~/.searchsploit_rc</code> file then we can easily look up exploits.</p>
<p>This is a search for items matching <code>ios</code> and <code>dos</code>:</p>

<h2 id="copyin_leak-exploit-45649"><code>copyin_leak</code> Exploit 45649</h2>
<p>This program allows a user program to get the kernel to expose memory values it should not be able to see. In that sense it is an information disclosure “leak.” The kernel routine used to do this is <code>copyin</code> hence it has been called a <code>copyin_leak</code>.</p>

<p>Here is the verbatim text for the write-up of this leak. The purpose for including it is to show the “level” at which exploit research is aimed at. The main aim of this book is to bring ourselves up to the same level so we can appreciate this piece of research, and then move forwards onto exploring and finding our own vulnerabilities.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here’s a code snippet from sleh.c with the second level exception handler for undefined instruction exceptions:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code> static void
 handle_uncategorized(arm_saved_state_t *state, boolean_t
 instrLen2)
 {
   exception_type_t       exception = EXC_BAD_INSTRUCTION;
   mach_exception_data_type_t   codes[2] = {EXC_ARM_UNDEFINED};
   mach_msg_type_number_t     numcodes = 2;
   uint32_t          instr;   &lt;------ (a)

   if (instrLen2) {
     uint16_t  instr16;
     COPYIN(get_saved_state_pc(state), (char *)&amp;instr16,
 sizeof(instr16));

     instr = instr16;
   } else {
     COPYIN(get_saved_state_pc(state), (char *)&amp;instr,
 sizeof(instr));  &lt;------- (b)
   }

 ....

  else {
   codes[1] = instr;   &lt;------ (c)
  }
 }

 exception_triage(exception, codes, numcodes);  &lt;-------- (d)</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>At (a) the uint32_t instr is declared uninitialized on the stack. At (b) the code tries to copyin the bytes of the exception-causing instruction from userspace note that the COPYIN macro doesn’t itself check the return value of copyin, it just calls it. At (c) instr is assigned to codes[1], which at (d) is passed to exception_triage.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>that codes array will eventually end up being sent in an exception mach message.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The bug is that we can force copyin to fail by unmapping the page containing the undefined instruction while it’s being handled. (I tried to do this with XO memory but the kernel seems to be able to copyin that just fine.)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This PoC has an undefined instruction (0xdeadbeef) on its own page and spins up a thread to keep switching the protection of that page between VM_PROT_NONE and VM_PROT_READ|VM_PROT_EXECUTE.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We then keep spinning up threads which try to execute that undefined instruction.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If the race windows align the thread executes the undefined instruction but when the sleh code tries to copyin the page is unmapped, the copying fails and the exception message we get has stale stack memory.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This PoC just demonstrates that you do get values which aren’t 0xdeadbeef in there for the EXC_ARM_UNDEFINED type. You’d have to do a bit more fiddling to work out how to get something specific there.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that there are lots of other unchecked COPYIN’s in sleh.c (eg when userspace tries to access a system register not allowed for EL0) and these seem to have the same issue.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>tested on iPod Touch 6g running 11.3.1, but looking at the kernelcache it seems to still be there in iOS 12.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Proof of Concept: https://github.com/offensive-security/exploitdb-bin-sploits/raw/m aster/bin-sploits/45649.zip</p>

<p>That’s the end of the write-up. It covers a lot of ground. In terms of technologies and techniques we have in the solution:</p>

<p>Now we just need to make sense of it all.</p>
<h2 id="the-road-ahead">The road ahead</h2>
<p>Having learnt where we can find Exploits, looking at our first exploit, and then seeing what technologies it relies upon, we can now chart out the road ahead.</p>
<h3 id="the-knowledge-we-require">The knowledge we require</h3>
<p>No one book can cover all the required topics in depth. But with the appropriate hacker mindset, a small subset of a large number of technologies can be learnt within the confines of one book.</p>
<p>After practice, a hacker mentality can zoom our attention to the most “interesting” aspects of a given technology. We should aim to have a T-shaped skill profile; shallow knowledge in many areas, but in-depth for certain pieces of those technologies. This is in contrast to a standard engineering T-shaped knowledge base where the in-depth knowledge is confined to one or two technologies.</p>
<h3 id="engineering-sensibilities">Engineering sensibilities</h3>
<p>If we are a professional software engineer, and look at Proof of Concept exploits the code structure and organisation often chafes at our engineering sensibilities. Compiler warning are ignored, variable names are terse or badly named. Functions are badly formed, with strange names, and dispersed business logic. Hardcoded values are rampant.</p>
<p>But the programs do “clever” things and use techniques often advanced programmers are unaware of. This is really a reflection of the patchwork of in-depth skills a hacker will acquire. Brilliance in some aspects, and beginner in others. Of course, hackers can also be skilled software engineers, system administrators, or have another profession. Such skills can be complementary but are not foundational. Hacker skills are not built on top of a layer of great system administration skills, nor software engineering skills.</p>
<h3 id="the-learning-pathway">The learning pathway</h3>
<p>There is a meta skill that underpins security research. That is, reading.</p>
<p>We have a goal to reach but don’t know half of the technologies needed. So we just do an internet search, pull down freely available learning material, and then skim through the contents.</p>
<p>The canonical texts are usually the best. In the first iteration it is usually a matter of downloading a manual of hundreds of pages. Then pressing Page-Down repeatedly and skimming through. Maybe 10 seconds per page. We are building up a mental model from the lowest level detail in a particular topic. At that point we have awareness of what we don’t know but enough knowledge to know a good search query to get into such a topic in more depth.</p>
<h3 id="deconstructing-our-world">Deconstructing our world</h3>
<p>Looking at canonical materials (that is, the text that most fully describes the content with a minimal amount of simplification) allows hackers to see systems as they really are, rather than an abstraction of what they are.</p>
<p>Software engineering is really the construction of layers of abstraction to get to a point of understanding of the task most naturally in the problem space we are working with. Researchers need to think about computers in the way they actually work, with all the abstractions stripped bare.</p>
<p>For example, when programmers see a virtual function in C++, they know that they need to look at what class is being messaged to understand what function the method will invoke. When hackers see a virtual function, they see that there must be a Virtual Function Table where the control flow is switched to the function that is desired. If the strategy in the mind of the researcher is to re-direct program control, then inspecting the code for virtual functions can be a goal.</p>
<p>Furthermore, reading a C++ manual which tells about how late binding works (as explained above with Virtual Function tables) allows those with a hacker mentality to make a mental note of the implied trust relationship in that code at such points. The Virtual Function Table if subverted will change the operation of the program.</p>
<h3 id="learning-from-exploits">Learning from Exploits</h3>
<p>Looking at existing exploits teaches what are the kinds of things about technologies we have that need to be learnt. That is so we don’t waste effort on non-critical knowledge. Granted all knowledge is valuable, but time is always going to be finite. So a trade-off is needed between learning knowledge in case it might be useful versus learning only what is needed for the job in hand.</p>
<h3 id="the-hacker-mindset">The hacker mindset</h3>
<p>Our path in learning and discovery is aided by a hacker mindset. This is closely connected to human psychology. What do humans do, and what opportunities are indirectly afforded through such human nature? There are formal ways of thinking to encourage a hacker mindset. We shall explore this in later chapters.</p>
<h3 id="research-goals">Research goals</h3>
<p>Looking at security exploits, we can ask what was the researcher aiming for which resulted in the fruits of the researcher. Research is not effective unless there is a strategic path that is being pursued. We shall explore this aspect of security research and show how this can amplify our efforts.</p>
<h1 id="mach-programming">Mach Programming</h1>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>The Operating Systems we know as iOS, macOS, tvOS, etc. are really different flavors of the Darwin Operating System. The same code base but compiled with different macro preprocessor flags.</p>
<p>The kernel of Darwin is XNU. The fundamental interface to XNU is via the Mach programming interface. At its core, XNU is based upon Mach messages.</p>
<p>The reason why we want to do Mach programming is because it is an interface available from user mode that can affect, leak or subvert the XNU kernel since they share the same data abstractions and programming methodology. Furthermore the fundamental abstractions are available as Open Source so can be inspected and understood easily.</p>
<p>One way to think about Mach is to consider it a fundamental building block that can be used to build out an Operating System personality.</p>
<p>Apple have created a UNIX personality for Darwin using Mach as an enabling technology. That is why there seems to be two competing interfaces in Darwin, the Mach programming interface, and the UNIX syscall interface.</p>
<p>It is straightforward to learn the UNIX syscall interface, because it follows the same paradigm as Linux. There are therefore many books and example programs written against the UNIX syscall interface. The details will vary but the approach is the same.</p>
<p>The Mach programming interface is somewhat esoteric. Apple seem to like to pretend that it does not exist. Even experienced iOS programmers will know little to nothing about it. However, time and again, this interface will be used to build exploits, so it is something we shall learn.</p>
<p>The original idea with Mach was to extend UNIX with new capabilities to tackle the emergence of multiprocessor systems and distributed computing more naturally. The solution was to add a new set of messaging primitives. <span class="citation" data-cites="machsyscalls">(Walmer and Thompson 1988)</span></p>
<p>When correctly coded, Mach based solutions can be elegant. When incorrectly coded, Mach based code offers an expansive attack surface. We shall study different techniques that abuse the Mach messaging system, such as Type Confusion. Furthermore, Mach based attacks can be Data oriented attacks, which side-step the traditional mitigations in the Operating System (such as stack overflow protection and control flow integrity).</p>
<h2 id="mach-fundamental-abstractions">Mach Fundamental Abstractions</h2>
<p>Mach <span class="citation" data-cites="machconcepts">(NeXT Software 1995)</span> is built upon the following abstractions:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Entry</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code>task</code></td>
<td>An execution environment.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code>thread</code></td>
<td>The basic unit of execution.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code>port</code></td>
<td>A communication channel.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code>message</code></td>
<td>A typed collection of data used for communication between threads</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In the original formulation, tasks could be on the same machine, on different processors in the machine, or on different machines. Such tasks become active entities when they host one or more threads. And threads can communicate with each other using well-defined interfaces that are invariant to whether the recipient is on the same machine or on a different machine.</p>
<p>In reality, due to the irrepressible properties of distributed communication, latency and reliability cannot be ignored. Therefore, such a uniform communication abstraction cannot work out satisfactorily in real systems. However, within a CPU with threads from the same task, or tasks in a parent-child relationship, the inherently well design message passing abstraction comes into its own. This is where the XNU kernel does its work and shines.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-learn-mach-programming">How to learn Mach programming</h2>
<p>Mach is not so easy to learn. There are few modern programs on GitHub to look at. One way into the topic is to study the NEXTSTEP documentation, <span class="citation" data-cites="machconcepts">(NeXT Software 1995)</span>. Despite its age, it is a well structured explanation of the concepts. Another source of documentation are the header files on macOS.</p>
<p>We can find the header file directory with:</p>
<pre><code># find /Applications/Xcode.app -type d -iname mach
/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/AppleTVOS.pl
atform/Developer/SDKs/AppleTVOS.sdk/usr/include/mach
/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.pla
tform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS.sdk/usr/include/mach
.
.
.</code></pre>
<p>Rather than duplicate or replace the NEXTSTEP documentation, we assume the reader will read all of that documentation, but for the practical work elements, refer to this book. This book then acts as a modernization of the original materials. As mentioned in the Introduction, this book is largely a tutorial guide to get us along the path to being able to find 0-day vulnerabilities.</p>
<h2 id="memory-allocation">Memory Allocation</h2>
<p>Here we follow along the <span class="citation" data-cites="machconcepts">(NeXT Software 1995)</span> documentation but with modernized code examples. These are available at <span class="citation" data-cites="trtzgithub">(Memon 2021)</span> in the subdirectory <code>source/mach-vm-alloc</code></p>
<p>Here is code that demonstrates how to allocate memory with Mach, how to duplicate memory, and then how to free memory.</p>

<h3 id="memory-allocation-discussion">Memory Allocation discussion</h3>
<p>In our code example, there are two stylistic points to note:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>We use a union to clearly characterise that Mach calls accept a handle, which is a <code>vm_address_t</code> but is clearly also just a raw pointer, <code>char *</code>, so we create a union comprising these two types depending on whether we are issuing Mach calls or doing normal C-based pointer arithmetic. The union avoids us having to use type casts.</p></li>
<li><p>We use a <code>goto</code> idiom to handle errors. All our <code>goto</code> statements go forwards (so don’t generate loops in our code) and just handle the error cases. This makes such exception handling clean without too much code repetition. That is useful because nearly all our function calls can return an error to be checked.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In our code we make the following observations:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>We need to have the port of the task before any of the system calls can be made because any message port the system returns is namespaced to port of the task it relates to. <code>mach_task_self()</code> provides us this. It is not actually a function call, it is a #define which provides us our thread-specific task value. The value is typically a small integer.</p></li>
<li><p><code>vm_allocate()</code> allocates memory. It is logical to ask for a page sized amount of memory because this is the unit of memory upon which virtual protection and management is done. This will be 16 KiB.</p></li>
<li><p><code>vm_read()</code> actually also allocates memory as <code>vm_allocate()</code> does. The function names do not have a nomenclature that tells us this, so it is worthwhile checking the function meaning each time until we are familiar with them.</p></li>
<li><p><code>vm_deallocate()</code> deallocates our memory; we did a <code>vm_allocate()</code> and a <code>vm_read()</code> allocation so there are two pages of memory to free up.</p></li>
<li><p>It is a good practice to check return values against <code>!= KERN_SUCCESS</code> and let <code>mach_error_string</code> handle the different possible error return values, since there are many error values possible.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This <code>vm_example()</code> code merely needs to be hooked into our App code when it launches, in the <code>main()</code> function to operate. It does feel heavyweight for what it does.</p>
<h2 id="copy-on-write-memory">Copy-on-Write Memory</h2>

<h3 id="copy-on-write-discussion">Copy-on-Write Discussion</h3>
<p>As we can see the <code>vm_inherit()</code> routine will provide both the child and parent access to the same memory until it is modified. After that, the child and parent have separate memory pages representing their own copy of the data values which can now be different.</p>
<p>This program uses a very primitive form of task coordination: busy while loops. A realistic example would use the <code>pthread</code> library instead for signalling and coordination.</p>
<h2 id="further-steps">Further steps</h2>
<p>We now leave the Mach programming introduction. There aren’t really any big example programs that use Mach so it is hard to get an appreciation of how to program with it. The main Mach program is the XNU kernel itself. So our next steps on our learning journey is to understand how to debug and probe the XNU kernel. From this we can get live experience with how Mach works. We shall see how the system interacts with Mach and how security (Mandatory Access Control (MAC)) is woven into the system at this lowest level.</p>
<h1 id="kernel-debugging">Kernel Debugging</h1>
<p>There is a good textbook on the Darwin family of Operating Systems; see <span class="citation" data-cites="newosxbook">Levin (n.d.)</span>. In this chapter however, we aim for a practical hands-on approach, and defer theory until later on our journey.</p>
<p>Discovering 0-days is mostly a practical exercise, accompanied by a knowledge of strategy, a bedrock of theory, and a toolchain of reverse engineering tools.</p>
<p>In the same way that beginner programmers, particularly from an academic training, try to design and architect their system before starting to code (and thus missing information and hitting knowledge gaps), beginner hackers try to read everything about the target system before cracking them. Hacking is mostly a journey of discovery just like software engineering. Only trivial, or previously well practiced systems are ameniable to big up-front design approaches. Also, knowing less about a system can sometimes be advantageous because new avenues are tried or novel approaches are discovered.</p>
<h2 id="booting-and-exploring-a-development-kernel">Booting and exploring a Development Kernel</h2>
<p>This section is a practical tutorial on how to setup a system for interactive kernel level debugging.</p>
<p>At a high level, this is our workflow:</p>
<p><img src="KernelDebugSetup.png" /></p>
<h3 id="data-safety">Data Safety</h3>
<p>Experimenting with kernels can be like playing with fire. The target machine must be throwaway; it might end up no longer booting, or be stuck in a boot loop. The data on its disk might get corrupted or lost. It is important to set up a discipline of keeping our work machine separate from our lab machine. Furthermore, it is good to have different login identities and credentials between these two environments. For example we wouldn’t want a quirk in a beta environment causing corruption to an iCloud resource we rely upon in our work environment.</p>
<p>Unfortunately good “data hygiene” is mostly learnt after a painful data loss. To avoid this, it is best to have in place a good backup strategy before experimenting with lab environments, and potential unsafe configurations and software. One such strategy is to have all our code in a cloud service provider, such as GitHub, have our documents and photos mirrored to iCloud, have our desktop systems backed-up to Time Machine and the high value personal documents, license keys, etc. kept also on Write-Only DVD media.</p>

<h3 id="required-hardware">Required Hardware</h3>
<p>It is surprisingly helpful to collect a random collection of old computers, peripherals, and connectors. Sometimes an interesting vulnerability is seen only on old hardware, or a technique is only useable on old hardware. Variety is the key so that different types of lab setups are possible.</p>
<p>In this tutorial we use a MacBook Pro target which has native USB-C interfaces. We connect a Thunderbolt USB-C to Thunderbolt adapter, and then connect a Thunderbolt Gigabit Ethernet Adapter to the Thunderbolt interface. Then we connect the ethernet cable to the host computer. The host computer is a Mac Mini based upon Apple Silicon.</p>
<p>This choice of hardware comes from particular requirements.</p>
<h4 id="direct-thunderbolt-communication">Direct thunderbolt communication</h4>
<p>When a system boots up, early on in its bring-up, it has few hardcoded facilities immediately at its disposal. The kernel will not have brought up its networking stack fully. This means for debug communication, it can only use a few hard coded facilities. The Kernel Development Kit from Apple documents what hardware is supported. It basically maps to either direct on-thunderbolt ethernet adapters or FireWire based connections.</p>
<p>The FireWire based communication is less flexible than Ethernet and is more of a legacy interface. So we shall ignore that option in this tutorial.</p>
<p>We can use either the Gigabit Ethernet adapters or the 10 Gigabit Ethernet adapters (for Mac Pro) from Apple. A USB Ethernet adapter will not work because it won’t be able to route the debug communication packet onto that device.</p>
<p>Note that most all-in-one adapters that connect to USB-C and offer a variety of ports including Ethernet will not work because the internal archictecture of these will have a USB Bus, and then there will be an affordable but lower performance Ethernet chip, such as a RealTek. There are two problems here. Firstly the RealTek is not a supported chip for debug communication, and secondly the kernel cannot route the debug packet from the Thunderbolt bus onto the USB bus where the Ethernet chip resides.</p>
<p>Notice that in our setup we first convert USB-C to Thunderbolt, and then convert Thunderbolt to Gigabit Ethernet. One advantage of our setup is that is it more flexible. Not all computers have native USB-C, but having two adapters means we have the flexibility to debug older computers.</p>
<h4 id="using-a-laptop-target">Using a laptop target</h4>
<p>One convenience arising from choosing a laptop as the debug target is that we can map the power key to halt the kernel and drop into the debugger. Also since the keyboard and trackpad are integrated, it means we have direct connectivity into the system.</p>
<h3 id="required-software">Required Software</h3>
<p>In order to do kernel debugging conveniently, we need a kernel with its debug symbols available so we can set symbolic breakpoints. We get the kernel version from the target machine as follows:</p>
<pre><code>target-mbp2018 # sw_vers
ProductName:    macOS
ProductVersion: 11.3
BuildVersion:   20E5186d</code></pre>
<p>We need to get the matching Kernel Development Kit (KDK) from the Apple developer website <span class="citation" data-cites="devapplemore">Apple (2021d)</span> We search for it using the build version, and it either it matches exactly, such as “Kernel Debug Kit 11.3 build 20E5186d,” or it is not found. When it is not found, we are supposed to raise a developer support ticket to ask for it to be uploaded onto the Apple Website. An easier alternative is to just update our version of macOS to a version which is also shown on the <span class="citation" data-cites="devapplemore">Apple (2021d)</span> website.</p>
<p>The KDK software is needed both on the target (we shall install the development kernel on it), and on the host (we need it available so the debugger can reference it). An exact same KDK must be used on both target and host.</p>
<h3 id="disable-file-vault">Disable File Vault</h3>
<p>In order to manipulate the root file system when in Recovery Mode, we need to first disable File Vault. This is normally a background task and takes a while but is immediate on our MacBook Pro because its disk is managed by a T2 chip. (<span class="citation" data-cites="disablefilevault">Apple (2021e)</span>)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Use <code>System Preferences &gt; Security &amp; Privacy &gt; FileVault</code></li>
<li>Unlock the padlock.</li>
<li>Click <code>Turn off FileVault</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Allow the system to process the decryption in the background. We must keep our system connected by AC power the whole time to achieve this.</p>
<h3 id="disk-information">Disk information</h3>
<p>We shall do low level disk operations on our target machine, so first need to record the hardware device used for the root file system:</p>
<pre><code>target-mbp2018 # df /
Filesystem     512-blocks     Used Available Capacity iused     
 ifree %iused  Mounted on
/dev/disk1s5s1 1953595632 59785248 469854808    12%  555854
 9767422306    0%   /</code></pre>
<p>This shows that in our case, we have APFS Container 1, Volume 5, Snapshot 1 representing the hard disk for the root file system. So our disk (ignoring the snapshot) is <code>disk1s5</code>.</p>
<h3 id="network-information">Network information</h3>
<p>We shall be connecting to the target via the Thunderbolt Gigabit Ethernet, so we need to know the Ethernet port name used for it. First we connect our adapters to the machine, and then assuming there is only one Gigabit Ethernet port, we run the command:</p>
<pre><code>target-mbp2018 # ifconfig | grep -B6 1000baseT
en9: flags=8863&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu
 1500
    options=50b&lt;RXCSUM,TXCSUM,VLAN_HWTAGGING,AV,CHANNEL_IO&gt;
    ether 28:ec:95:03:b3:a6 
    inet6 fe80::18f5:dff5:a92b:d3ff%en9 prefixlen 64 secured
 scopeid 0x14 
    inet 169.254.203.131 netmask 0xffff0000 broadcast
 169.254.255.255
    nd6 options=201&lt;PERFORMNUD,DAD&gt;
    media: autoselect (1000baseT
 &lt;full-duplex,flow-control,energy-efficient-ethernet&gt;)</code></pre>
<p>So our network interface is <code>en9</code> and our target machine appears on that interface as IP address <code>169.254.203.131</code>.</p>
<h3 id="kernel-debug-flags">Kernel Debug Flags</h3>
<p>When we setup our target for debugging, to head off potential boot-time issues, we need to establish what custom boot flags we shall use for booting and debugging. Technically speaking, these settings are tied to the particular kernel version we are debugging. The settings, however, change only occasionally.</p>
<p>Kernel information is available from the Open Source archives published by Apple. (<span class="citation" data-cites="appleopensource">Apple (2021b)</span>) We find that the release of such sources is delayed after the release of a given version of macOS. iOS kernel source is not published. However, it is macOS that is the most instructive because all the platforms are based on the same XNU kernel with just compile flag and device support differences. The convergence of the platforms at a low level allows the macOS platform to give good insights into all Apple platforms. We note, however, that the user experience is differentiated between the Apple platforms since the user needs to consume and experience the platform differently based upon the form factor of the system. These differences are mainly manifest in the library software layers on top of the XNU kernel.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the latest Apple Open Source release for macOS is 11.2 despite our target machine being 20E5186d. So we download its corresponding XNU kernel, <code>xnu-7195.81.3</code>.</p>
<p>The file <code>osfmk/kern/debug.h</code> describes the boot parameters that are available.</p>

<p>We require:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>DB_NMI</code>: we want to enter the debugger upon a Non-Maskable Interrupt</li>
<li><code>DB_ARP</code>: we want the debugger communication to be over Address Resolution Protocol (in fact UDP packets)</li>
<li><code>DB_NMI_BTN_ENA</code>: we want the power button being tapped to generate a Non-Maskable Interrupt</li>
</ul>
<p>Hence we shall plan on supplying the debug boot argument <code>debug=0x8044</code></p>
<h3 id="assumed-configuration">Assumed Configuration</h3>
<p>For ease of explanation, we setup the following environmental variables matching our lab setup:</p>
<pre><code>TARGET=target-mbp2018
DISK=disk1s5
KERNEL=20E5186d
KDK=KDK_11.3_20E5186d.kdk
NETWORK_INTERFACE=en9</code></pre>
<h3 id="software-installation">Software Installation</h3>
<p>We need to install our software first because later steps will utilise it from Recovery Mode.</p>
<h4 id="host-side-software">Host side software</h4>
<p>The host must install Xcode, and the specific KDK determined earlier.</p>
<h4 id="target-side-software">Target side software</h4>
<p>The target must install the KDK determined earlier.</p>
<h3 id="lowering-security">Lowering Security</h3>
<p>In order to debug our target we must lower the security settings. (<span class="citation" data-cites="installxnu">Shaman (2021)</span>) We have three tasks to do whilst booted into Recovery Mode.</p>
<h4 id="disable-system-integrity-protection-sip">Disable System Integrity Protection (SIP)</h4>
<p>We need to disable System Integrity Protection (SIP) using the Configurable Security Restrictions Utility (<code>csrutil</code>). Apple documentation <span class="citation" data-cites="configsip">Apple (2021c)</span> tells us to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Boot into recovery mode (Command+R during boot)</li>
<li>Launch a Terminal window from <code>Utilities &gt; Terminal</code>.</li>
<li>Run <code>csrutil disable</code></li>
<li>Quit the Terminal.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="set-no-boot-security">Set No Boot Security</h4>
<p>We need to set boot security to No Security. (<span class="citation" data-cites="startupsecurity">Apple (2021a)</span>)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Launch <code>Utilities &gt; Startup Security Utility</code></li>
<li>In section Secure Boot, set “No Security”</li>
<li>Quit the Utility.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="disable-authenticated-root-volume-security">Disable Authenticated Root Volume Security</h4>
<p>We need to disable authenticated Root Volume Security. (<span class="citation" data-cites="rootvolsecurity">Sorresso (2021)</span>)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Launch a Terminal window from <code>Utilities &gt; Terminal</code>.</li>
<li>Run <code>csrutil authenticated-root disable</code> (Requires FileVault to be already disabled.)</li>
<li>Quit the Terminal.</li>
<li>Restart the computer.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="configuring-the-development-kernel">Configuring the Development Kernel</h3>
<p>Having rebooted our target machine, with the lowered security, we can adjust our machine to use the Development Kernel. This makes use of a kernel debugger easier since we have the kernel symbols for it that our debugger can use.</p>
<h4 id="mount-read-write-the-root-file-system">Mount Read Write the Root File System</h4>
<pre><code>export TARGET=target-mbp2018 DISK=disk1s5 KERNEL=20E5186d
 NETWORK_INTERFACE=en9 KDK=KDK_11.3_20E5186d.kdk
mkdir /tmp/mnt
sudo mount -o nobrowse -t apfs /dev/$DISK /tmp/mnt</code></pre>
<p>We should now have the root disk mounted Read Only and mounted Read Write</p>
<pre><code>target-mbp2018 # mount
/dev/disk1s5s1 on / (apfs, sealed, local, read-only, journaled)
.
.
/dev/disk1s5 on /private/tmp/mnt (apfs, sealed, local, journaled,
 nobrowse)</code></pre>
<h4 id="install-the-development-kernel">Install the Development Kernel</h4>
<p>We place the development kernel on our system with:</p>
<pre><code>sudo cp
 /Library/Developer/KDKs/$KDK/System/Library/Kernels/kernel.devel
opment /tmp/mnt/System/Library/Kernels</code></pre>
<h4 id="bless-the-root-file-system">Bless the Root File System</h4>
<p>We make our modified root file system bootable by the system by using the <code>bless</code> command.</p>
<pre><code>sudo bless --folder /tmp/mnt/System/Library/CoreServices
 --bootefi --create-snapshot</code></pre>
<h4 id="set-boot-parameters">Set boot parameters</h4>
<p>We need to set the boot parameters to use the development kernel. We also need to make it:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Use the thunderbolt ethernet adapter (<code>kdp_match_name=en9</code>),</li>
<li>Not go to sleep when debugging (<code>wdt=-1</code>),</li>
<li>Verbose boot for debugging (<code>-v</code>)</li>
<li>Use Power Key for entering the debugger over UDP packets (<code>debug=0x8044</code>),</li>
</ol>
<p>In our lab configuration, this is done with:</p>
<pre><code>export NETWORK_INTERFACE=en9
sudo nvram boot-args=&quot;debug=0x8044
 kdp_match_name=$NETWORK_INTERFACE wdt=-1 -v&quot;</code></pre>
<h4 id="target-machine-reboot">Target machine reboot</h4>
<p>Now we have everything in place. The target machine can be rebooted. If we watch it reboot closely, we can see that as it reboots, a lot of debug information will be printed onto the screen as part of the reboot.</p>
<h3 id="host-machine-configuration">Host machine configuration</h3>
<p>At this point we have a host machine with Xcode, and the KDK installed on it. Only one further change is needed.</p>
<p>The KDK comes with helper scripts to aid kernel debugging. These are tied to the Python 2 runtime environment, but Xcode LLDB Debugger uses Python 3 as the default. We need to switch to Python 2 as follows:</p>
<pre><code>defaults write com.apple.dt.lldb DefaultPythonVersion 2</code></pre>
<h3 id="interactive-debugging">Interactive debugging</h3>
<p>The host machine should be connected to the target machine. It should have the KDK installed on it. The Apple Spotlight feature will index it, and thus will be aware of the KDK symbols without it being explicitly told about them.</p>
<p>On the target machine, we need to get the most recent IP address it has allocated for the Gigabit Ethernet interface <code>en9</code> (<code>$NETWORK_INTERFACE</code>).</p>
<pre><code>target-mbp2018 # ifconfig en9
en9: flags=8863&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu
 1500
    options=50b&lt;RXCSUM,TXCSUM,VLAN_HWTAGGING,AV,CHANNEL_IO&gt;

    media: autoselect (1000baseT
 &lt;full-duplex,flow-control,energy-efficient-ethernet&gt;)
    status: active</code></pre>
<p>Here we have IP Address <code>169.254.136.48</code>.</p>
<p>We now press the Power button on the target. It must be a normal press, not a tap, nor a long press. This will trigger the Non-Maskable Interrupt and freeze the machine, and it will then hunt for a kernel debugger connection.</p>
<p>On the host machine, we run the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>lldb
kdp-remote 169.254.136.48</code></pre>
<p>At this point we will get a large information dump from the target machine, detailing the kernel extensions currently running:</p>
