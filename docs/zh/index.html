<h1 id="preface">Preface</h1>
<p>This book has come about because having written a book on iOS Crash Dump Analysis, I found that most of my audience were security-focussed engineers.</p>
<p>I share the same passion. I have been studying various “Crack Me” challenges. I thought I was doing the correct preparation for vulnerability analysis.</p>
<p>When I looked at successful exploits, mostly on Google Project Zero <span class="citation" data-cites="gpz">(“Google Project Zero” 2021)</span>, I found there was a technique gap. Not only do you need to apply standard techniques, you need to apply them on unfamiliar APIs, such as <code>IOSurface</code> and <code>XPC</code>. So I naturally looked at Crack Me challenges using those APIs. I wasn’t able to find any.</p>
<p>What I am attempting to do is to document my journey in acquiring the skills to find Zero Day Vulnerabilities on iOS in the form of a book. That is so that future engineers will have a book to take them along the same journey.</p>
<p>So the nature of this book is mostly a tutorial but with appropriate theory explanations or system knowledge explained along the way.</p>
<p>I take the view that when you are exploring new things, cost barriers are magnified because you are not sure at the time whether you will stick with it or enjoy it. Paying a lot of money for golf clubs is a straightforward choice if you’ve already fallen in love with the game. So I am going to work on the basis the reader has modest resources to hand (compared to the professionals in this area). I assume you have an iDevice, a Mac, an Xcode developer account, and maybe software, free or licensed at modest cost.</p>
<p>There is one last element I intend to add to the mix. The Hacker Mentality. This is the attitude of mind where an innocent piece of information can be viewed through a hacker’s lens. That offers the foothold for us to commence experimentation and discovery that then later will result in new vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>If I am successful, I hope this book will become the handbook of vulnerability craftsmanship in the same way that Code Complete (<span class="citation" data-cites="codecomplete2">McConnell (2004)</span>) became the handbook of software craftsmanship.</p>
<p>One thing in particular that attracts me to iOS is that its one of the hardest platforms to circumvent. It may turn out I don’t reach the high bar needed to make progress on this platform. But if it was going to be easy, what would be the point in trying?</p>
<h1 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h1>
<p>I’d like to acknowledge the help and support of my colleagues for writing this book.</p>
<p>I am indebted to the support of my Chinese-language translator, TBC, for helping bring the Chinese edition of the book into fruition.</p>
<p>Putting together this work was only possible because it was built upon generously provided open source tools, in particular <code>pandoc</code> which made writing the text of the book a pleasure.</p>
<p>Lastly, I’d like to thank my supportive family whilst I was locked in my study, and largely absent. Thank you Junghyun, and Christopher.</p>

<p>TODO：撰写此简介。</p>
<p>此摘录和其他一些摘录自动生成为中文，因为在开始实际的人工翻译版本之前，我需要检查所有版式问题。</p>
<p>作为本书的补充，还有一个资源网站，旨在与印刷材料一起使用，以便您可以自己设置并运行示例项目并进行试验。 本书最后的所有参考文献都收录在书目章节中。 例如，您可以在其中找到资源的URL。</p>
