*Security Update 2004-12-02*

* *Apache* +
Available for: Mac OS X Server v10.3.6, Mac OS X Server v10.2.8 +
CVE-ID: CAN-2004-1082 +
Impact: Apache mod_digest_apple authentication is vulnerable to replay
attacks. +
Description: The Mac OS X Server specific mod_digest_apple is based on
Apache's mod_digest. Multiple corrections for a replay problem in
mod_digest were made in versions 1.3.31 and 1.3.32 of Apache
(CAN-2003-0987). This update corrects the replay problem in
mod_digest_apple authentication using the modifications made to Apache
1.3.32.
* *Apache* +
Available for: Mac OS X v10.3.6, Mac OS X Server v10.3.6, Mac OS X
v10.2.8, Mac OS X Server v10.2.8 +
CVE-ID: CAN-2003-0020, CAN-2003-0987, CAN-2004-0174, CAN-2004-0488,
CAN-2004-0492, CAN-2004-0885, CAN-2004-0940 +
Impact: Multiple vulnerabilities in Apache and mod_ssl including local
privilege escalation, remote denial of service and in some modified
configurations execution of arbitrary code. +
Description: The Apache Group fixed a number of vulnerabilities between
versions 1.3.29 and 1.3.33. The Apache Group security page for Apache
1.3 is located at http://www.apacheweek.com/features/security-13. The
previously installed version of Apache was 1.3.29. The default
installation of Apache does not enable mod_ssl. This update fixes all of
applicable issues by updating Apache to version 1.3.33 and the companion
mod_ssl to version 2.8.22.
* *Apache* +
Available for: Mac OS X v10.3.6, Mac OS X Server v10.3.6, Mac OS X
v10.2.8, Mac OS X Server v10.2.8 +
CVE-ID: CAN-2004-1083 +
Impact: Apache configurations did not fully block access to ".DS_Store"
files or those starting with ".ht". +
Description: A default Apache configuration blocks access to files
starting with ".ht" in a case sensitive way. The Apple HFS+ filesystem
performs file access in a case insensitive way. The Finder may also
create .DS_Store files containing the names of files in locations used
to serve web pages. This update modifies the Apache configuration to
restricts access to all files beginning with ".ht" or ".DS_S" regardless
of capitalization.
http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=300421[More...]
* *Apache* +
Available for: Mac OS X v10.3.6, Mac OS X Server v10.3.6, Mac OS X

CVE-ID: CAN-2004-1084 +
Impact: File data and resource fork content can be retrieved via HTTP
bypassing normal Apache file handlers. +
Description: The Apple HFS+ filesystem permits files to have multiple
data streams. These data streams can be directly accessed using special
filenames. A specially crafted HTTP request can bypass an Apache file
handler and directly access file data or resource fork content. This
update modifies the Apache configuration to deny requests for file data
or resource fork content via their special filenames. For more
information, see
http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=300422[this document].

Available for: Mac OS X Server 10.2.8, Mac OS X Server 10.3.4, Mac OS X
Server 10.3.5 +
Impact: Exposure to a potential Denial of Service. +
Description: The Apache Organization has released Apache version 2.0.50.
This release fixes a number of denial of service vulnerabilities. We
have updated Apache to version 2.0.50 which only ships with Mac OS X
Server, and is off by default.
* *Component: CoreFoundation* +
CVE-ID: CAN-2004-0821 +
Available for: Mac OS X 10.2.8, Mac OS X 10.3.4, Mac OS X 10.3.5, Mac OS
X Server 10.2.8, Mac OS X Server 10.3.4, Mac OS X Server 10.3.5 +
Impact: Privileged programs using CoreFoundation can be made to load a
user supplied library. +
Description: Bundles using the CoreFoundation CFPlugIn facilities can
include directions to automatically load plugin executables. With a
specially crafted bundle this could also occur for privileged programs,
permitting a local privilege escalation. CoreFoundation now prevents
automatic executable loading for bundles that already have a loaded
executable. Credit to Kikuchi Masashi (kik@ms.u-tokyo.ac.jp) for
reporting this issue.
* *Component: CoreFoundation* +
CVE-ID: CAN-2004-0822 +

Impact: An environment variable can be manipulated to cause a buffer
overflow which can result in a privilege escalation +
Description: By manipulating an environment variable a program could
potentially be made to execute arbitrary code by a local attacker. This
can only be exploited with access to a local account. Stricter validity
checks are now performed for this environment variable. Credit to
aaron@vtty.com for reporting this issue.
* *Component: IPSec* +
CVE-ID: CAN-2004-0607 +
Available for: Mac OS X 10.2.8, Mac OS X 10.3.4, Mac OS X 10.3.5, Mac OS
X Server 10.2.8, Mac OS X Server 10.3.4, Mac OS X Server 10.3.5 +
Impact: When using certificates, unauthenticated hosts may be able to
negotiate an IPSec connection. +
Description: When configured to use X.509 certificates to authenticate
remote hosts, a certificate verification failure does not abort the key
exchange. Mac OS X does not use certificates for IPSec by default so
this issue only affects configurations that have been manually
configured. IPSec now verifies and aborts a key exchange if a
certificate verification failure occurs.
* *Component: Kerberos* +
CVE-ID: CAN-2004-0523 +
Available for: Mac OS X 10.2.8, Mac OS X 10.3.4, Mac OS X 10.3.5, Mac OS
X Server 10.2.8, Mac OS X Server 10.3.4, Mac OS X Server 10.3.5 +
Impact: Multiple buffer overflows in krb5_aname_to_localname for MIT
Kerberos 5 (krb5) 1.3.3 and earlier could permit remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code. +
Description: The buffer overflow can only be exploited if
"auth_to_local_names" or "auth_to_local" support is also configured in
the edu.mit.Kerberos file. Apple does not enable this by default. The
security fix was back ported and applied to the Mac OS X versions of
Kerberos. The Mac OS X and Mac OS X Server version of Kerberos is not
susceptible to the recent "double-free" issue reported in the CERT
vulnerability note VU#350792 (CAN-2004-0772). Credit to the MIT Kerberos
Development Team for informing us of this issue.

X Server 10.2.8, Mac OS X Server 10.3.4, Mac OS X Server 10.3.5 +
Impact: A race condition that can permit an authenticated remote
attacker to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code +
Description: If the FTP service has been enabled, and a remote attacker
can correctly authenticate, then a race condition would permit them to
stop the FTP service or execute arbitrary code. The fix is to replace
the lukemftpd FTP service with tnftpd. lukemftp is installed but not
activated in Mac OS X Server, which instead uses xftp. Credit to Luke
Mewburn of the NetBSD Foundation for informing us of this issue.
* *Component: OpenLDAP* +
CVE-ID: CAN-2004-0823 +
Available for: Mac OS X 10.3.4, Mac OS X 10.3.5, Mac OS X Server 10.3.4,
Mac OS X Server 10.3.5 +
Impact: A crypt password can be used as if it were a plain text
password. +
Description: Backwards compatibility with older LDAP implementations
permits the storing of a crypt password in the userPassword attribute.
Some authentication validation schemes can use this value as if it were
a plain text password. The fix removes the ambiguity and always uses
this type of field as a crypt password. This issue does not occur in Mac
OS X 10.2.8. Credit to Steve Revilak of Kayak Software Corporation for
reporting this issue.

_It is Apple's policy to quickly address significant vulnerabilities in
past releases of Mac OS X wherever feasible. Security Update 2003-11-19
includes updates to several components of Mac OS X 10.2 that meet this
criteria._

* *gm4: Fixes CAN-2001-1411* a format string vulnerability in the gm4 +
utility. No setuid root programs relied on gm4 and this fix is a +
preventive measure against a possible future exploit.
* *groff: Fixes* *CVE-2001-1022* ** where the groff component pic
contained a format-string vulnerability.
* *Mail: Fixes CAN-2003-0881* the Mac OS X Mail application will no
longer +
fall back to plain text login when an account is configured to use MD5 +
Challenge Response.
* *OpenSSL: Fixes CAN-2003-0851* parsing particular malformed ASN.1 +
sequences are now handled in a more secure manner.
* *Personal File Sharing: Fixes CAN-2003-0878* when Personal File
Sharing +
is enabled, the slpd daemon can no longer create a root-owned file in +
the /tmp directory to gain elevated privileges.
* *QuickTime for Java: Fixes CAN-2003-0871* a potential vulnerability
that +
could allow unauthorized access to a system.
* *zlib: Addresses CAN-2003-0107.* While there were no functions in
Mac +
OS X that used the vulnerable gzprintf() function, the underlying +
issue in zlib has been fixed to protect any third-party applications +
that may potentially use this library.

 +
 +
*Security Update 2003-11-19 for Panther 10.3.1*

* *OpenSSL: Fixes CAN-2003-0851* parsing particular malformed ASN.1 +
sequences are now handled in a more secure manner.
* *zlib: Addresses CAN-2003-0107.* While there were no functions in
Mac +
OS X that used the vulnerable gzprintf() function, the underlying +
issue in zlib has been fixed to protect any third-party applications +
that may potentially use this library.

 +
 +
*Security Update 2003-11-04*

* *Terminal: Addresses CAN-2003-0913* a potential vulnerability with the
Terminal application in Mac OS X 10.3 and Mac OS X Server 10.3 that
could allow unauthorized access to a system. Mac OS X versions earlier
than 10.3 are not affected.

 +
 +
*Security Update 2003-10-28*

* *Fixes CAN-2003-0871* a potential vulnerability in the implementation
of QuickTime Java in Mac OS X 10.3 and Mac OS X Server 10.3 that could
allow unauthorized access to a system.

 +
 +
*Mac OS X 10.3 Panther*

* *Finder: Fixes CAN-2003-0876* where folder permissions may not be +
preserved when copying a folder from a mounted volume such as a disk +
image. Credit to Dave G. from @stake, Inc. for finding this issue.
* *Kernel: Fixes CAN-2003-0877* where if a system is running with core +
files enabled, a user with interactive shell access can overwrite
arbitrary files, and read core +
files created by root-owned processes. This may result in sensitive +
information such as authentication credentials being compromised. Core +
file creation is disabled by default on Mac OS X. Credit to Dave G. +
from @stake, Inc. for finding this issue.
* *slpd: Fixes CAN-2003-0878* when Personal File Sharing is enabled,
the +
slpd daemon may create a root-owned file in the /tmp directory. This +
could overwrite an existing file and allow a user to gain elevated +
privileges. Personal File Sharing is off by default in Mac OS X.
Credit +
to Dave G. from @stake, Inc. for finding this issue.
* *Kernel: Fixes CAN-2003-0895* where it may be possible for a local
user +
to cause the Mac OS X kernel to crash by specifying a long command
line +
argument. The machine will reboot on its own after several minutes. +
Credit to Dave G. from @stake, Inc. for finding this issue.
* *ktrace: Fixes CVE-2002-0701* a theoretical exploit when ktrace is +
enabled through the KTRACE kernel option, a local user might be able
to +
obtain sensitive information. No specific utility is currently known +
to be vulnerable to this particular problem.
* *nfs: Fixes CVE-2002-0830* for the Network File System where a
remote +
user may be able to send RPC messages that cause the system to lock up.
* *zlib: Addresses CAN-2003-0107*. While there were no functions in Mac
OS +
X that used the vulnerable gzprintf() function, the underlying issue
in +
zlib has been fixed.
* *gm4: Fixes CAN-2001-1411* a format string vulnerability in the gm4 +
utility. No setuid root programs relied on gm4 and this fix is a +
preventive measure against a possible future exploit.
* *OpenSSH: Fixes CAN-2003-0386* where "from=" and "user@hosts"
restrictions are potentially spoofable via reverse DNS for numerically
specified IP addresses. Mac OS X 10.3 also incorporates prior fixes
released for OpenSSH, and the version of OpenSSH as obtained via the
"ssh -V" command is:  OpenSSH_3.6.1p1+CAN-2003-0693, SSH protocols
1.5/2.0, OpenSSL 0x0090702f
* *nidump: Fixes CAN-2001-1412* where the nidump utility provides
access +
to the crypted passwords used to authenticate logins.
* *System Preferences: Fixes CAN-2003-0883* where after authenticating +
with an administrator password, the system will continue to allow +
access to secure Preference Panes for a short period of time. This +
could allow a local user to access Preference Panes that they would
not +
normally be able to use. In Mac OS X 10.3 Security preferences, there +
is now a choice to "Require password to unlock each secure system +
preference". Credit to Anthony Holder for reporting this issue.
* *TCP timestamp: Fixes CAN-2003-0882* where the TCP timestamp is +
initialized with a constant number. This could allow a person to +
discover how long the system has been up based upon the ID in TCP +
packets. In Mac OS X 10.3, the TCP timestamp is now initialized with a +
random number. Credit to Aaron Linville for reporting this issue and +
submitting a fix via the Darwin open source program.
* *Mail: Fixes CAN-2003-0881* in the Mac OS X Mail application, if an +
account is configured to use MD5 Challenge Response, it will attempt
to +
login using CRAM-MD5 but will silently fall back to plain-text if the +
hashed login fails. Credit to Chris Adams for reporting this issue.
* *Dock: Fixes CAN-2003-0880* when Full Keyboard Access is turned on
via +
the Keyboard pane in System Preferences, Dock functions can be
accessed +
blindly from behind Screen Effects.

 +
 +
*Mac OS X 10.2.8 +
*

* *OpenSSL: Fixes CAN-2003-0543, CAN-2003-0544, CAN-2003-0545* to
address potential issues in certain ASN.1 structures and in certificate
verification code. To deliver the update in a rapid and reliable manner,
only the patches for the CVE IDs listed above were applied, and not the
entire latest OpenSSL library. Thus, the OpenSSL version in Mac OS X
10.2.8, as obtained via the "openssl version" command, is: OpenSSL
0.9.6i Feb 19 2003
* *OpenSSH: Addresses CAN-2003-0693, CAN-2003-0695, and CAN-2003-0682*
to fix buffer management errors in OpenSSH's sshd versions prior to
3.7.1. To deliver the update in a rapid and reliable manner, only the
patches for CVE IDs listed above were applied, and not the entire set of
patches for OpenSSH 3.7.1. Thus, the OpenSSH version in Mac OS X 10.2.8,
as obtained via the "ssh -V" command, is: OpenSSH_3.4p1+CAN-2003-0693,
SSH protocols 1.5/2.0, OpenSSL 0x0090609f
* *sendmail: Addresses CAN-2003-0694 and CAN-2003-0681* to fix a buffer
overflow in address parsing, as well as a potential buffer overflow in
ruleset parsing.
* *fb_realpath(): Fixes CAN-2003-0466* which is an off-by-one error in
the fb_realpath() function that may allow attackers to execute arbitrary
code.
* *arplookup(): Fixes CAN-2003-0804.* The arplookup() function caches
ARP requests for routes on a local link. On a local subnet only, it is
possible for an attacker to send a sufficient number of spoofed ARP
requests which will exhaust kernel memory, leading to a denial of
service.
