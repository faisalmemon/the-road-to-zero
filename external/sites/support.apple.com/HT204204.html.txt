== Update your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch

Find out how to update your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch to the latest
version of iOS or iPadOS.

[[sections]]
You can update your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch to the latest version of
iOS or iPadOS wirelessly.

If you're using iOS or iPadOS 14.5 or later, you may now see the option
to choose between two software update versions. This option allows you
to choose between updating to the latest version of iOS or iPadOS 15 as
soon as it's released, or continuing on iOS or iPadOS 14 while still
getting important security updates for a period of time.

If you can't see the update on your device, you can update manually
using your computer. Find out how to update your device
manually https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT212185[if you’re using a Mac
with macOS Catalina or later], or
https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT212186[if you're using a Mac with
macOS Mojave or earlier or a Windows PC].

=== Before you update

http://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT203977[Back up your device] using
iCloud or your computer.

=== Update your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch wirelessly

If a message says that an update is available, tap Install Now to update
now. Or you can tap Later and choose Install Tonight or Remind Me
Later. If you tap Install Tonight, just plug your device into power at
night and your device will update automatically overnight.

You can also follow these steps: 

. Plug your device into power and
https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202639[connect to the internet with
Wi-Fi].
. Go to Settings > General, then tap Software Update. +
. If you see two software update options available, choose the one that
you want to install. +
image:/library/content/dam/edam/applecare/images/en_US/iOS/ios15-iphone12-pro-settings-general-software-update.png[image,width=320]
. Tap Install Now. If you see Download and Install instead, tap it to
download the update, enter your passcode, then tap Install
Now. https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204306[If you don’t know your
passcode, find out what to do].

You may see that your device is up to date on its current
version, and there's an update available. For example, even if your
device is up to date on the latest version of iOS 14, there may be an
option to update to iOS 15.

==== If you see an alert when updating wirelessly

Find out what to do https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201435[if you see
an alert message while trying to update your device wirelessly].

[.note]#Some software updates aren't available wirelessly. VPN or proxy
connections may prevent your device from contacting the update servers.#

==== If you need more space when updating wirelessly

If a message asks to temporarily remove apps because the software needs
more space for the update, tap Continue to allow apps to be removed.
After installation is complete, those apps will automatically be
reinstalled. If you tap Cancel instead,
you can https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT203097[delete content
manually] from your device to add more space.

=== Customise automatic updates

Your device can update automatically overnight while it's charging.
Here's how to turn on automatic updates:

. Go to Settings > General > Software Update.
. Tap Automatic Updates, then turn on Download iOS Updates.
. Turn on Install iOS Updates. Your device will automatically be updated
to the latest version of iOS or iPadOS. Some updates may need to be
installed manually. +

system performance may be influenced by many factors including network
