== Update your Apple Watch

Use your iPhone to update your Apple Watch software, or update directly
on your Apple Watch.

[[sections]]
=== Keeping your Apple Watch up to date

To make sure your Apple devices have the latest bug fixes and security
enhancements, keep your devices up to date. Some iOS updates may also
require you to update watchOS.

==== If your iPhone says 'Update Apple Watch'

When you see an alert on your iPhone that says “Your Apple Watch
software is out of date”, you should update to the latest version of
watchOS so that your data, including Activity data, continues to sync to
your iPhone.

Find out what to do if your Apple Watch says
https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT211283[you need more available storage
to install a watchOS update].

image:/library/content/dam/edam/applecare/images/en_US/mac_apps/itunes/divider.png[image]

=== Get ready to update

First, make sure your Apple Watch is compatible with the latest
software: watchOS 8 is compatible with Apple Watch Series 3 and later
and Apple Watch SE. Upgrading to watchOS 8 requires iPhone 6s or later
running iOS 15 or later. https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204507[Find
your Apple Watch model].

Next, check these things:

. https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204204[Update your iPhone] to the
latest version of iOS.
. Make sure your Apple Watch is at least
https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204608[50 per cent charged].
. https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202639[Connect your iPhone to
Wi-Fi].
. Keep your iPhone next to your Apple Watch, so that they're in range. 

It could take from several minutes to an hour for the update to
complete. You may want to update overnight or wait until you have time.

=== Update your Apple Watch using your iPhone

When a new update is available, your Apple Watch notifies you. Tap
Update Tonight in the notification, then go to your iPhone to confirm
that you want to update overnight. At the end of the day, leave your
Apple Watch and iPhone charging overnight so the update can complete. 

To update manually, use these steps: 

. On your iPhone, open the Apple Watch app, then tap the My Watch tab. 
. Tap General > Software Update. +

screen showing an available software update for Apple Watch,width=350]
. Download the update. If asked for your iPhone passcode or Apple Watch
passcode, enter it. 
. Wait for the progress wheel to appear on your Apple Watch. It could
take from several minutes to an hour for the update to complete. 

[.callout]#Leave your Apple Watch on its charger while the update
completes. Don't restart your iPhone or Apple Watch, and don't quit the
Apple Watch app. When the update is complete, your Apple Watch will
restart on its own.#

image:/library/content/dam/edam/applecare/images/en_US/mac_apps/itunes/divider.png[image]

=== Update directly on your Apple Watch

If your Apple Watch has watchOS 6 or later, you can install subsequent
updates without your iPhone:

. Make sure your watch is
https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT209071[connected to Wi-Fi].
. On your watch, open the Settings app.
. Tap General > Software Update.
. Tap Install if a software update is available, then follow the
onscreen instructions.

[.callout]#Leave your Apple Watch on its charger while the update
completes, and don't restart your Apple Watch. When the update is
complete, your Apple Watch will restart on its own.#

image:/library/content/dam/edam/applecare/images/en_US/mac_apps/itunes/divider.png[image]

=== If you need help updating

Try these steps:

. https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204640[Make sure your Apple Watch
connects to its charger]. 
. Restart your Apple Watch. Press and hold the side button until you see
Power Off, then drag the slider. To turn your watch on again, press and
hold the side button.
. https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201559[Restart your paired iPhone].
. Try to start the update again. 

If the update won't start, open the Watch app on your iPhone, tap
General > Usage > Software Update, then delete the update file. After
you delete the file, try to download and install watchOS again.

Find out what to do https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT211283[if you see
'Cannot Install Update' when updating Apple Watch].

=== If you installed an iOS or watchOS beta or developer seed

. Before you update, remove the beta profile from your device. To view
and remove the watchOS beta profile:
* Open the Apple Watch app on your iPhone, tap the My Watch tab, then go
to General > Profiles. Tap the beta profile that you want to remove,
then tap Delete Profile. Enter your iPhone passcode if requested. 
* Open the Settings app on your iPhone, then tap General > Profiles &
Device Management. Tap the beta profile that you want to remove, then
tap Delete profile. Enter your iPhone passcode if requested. 
. After you remove the profiles, restart both devices and check for the
update again.

To continue using the public beta of iOS, you can install the beta
profile again.
