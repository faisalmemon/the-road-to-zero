=== Security updates are usually incorporated into later Software Updates

Security updates released for OS X are usually incorporated into the
next OS X Software Update.

Security updates may also be available for software released
independently from OS X. Software Updates are packaged in a manner to
keep systems secure. Security updates are only offered to systems that
need the update, and not to later versions that have incorporated the
Security Update. For more information, see the "Some, but not all,
updates are displayed" section
of http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1569[this document].

Information about products not manufactured by Apple, or independent
websites not controlled or tested by Apple, is provided without
recommendation or endorsement. Apple assumes no responsibility with
regard to the selection, performance, or use of third-party websites or
products. Apple makes no representations regarding third-party website
accuracy or reliability. http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2693[Contact the
