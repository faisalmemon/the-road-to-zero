== About background updates in macOS

Your Mac automatically installs background updates for the security
configuration and data files used by macOS.

[[sections]]
Keeping your software up to date is one of the most important things you
can do to maintain the security of your Mac. That includes installing
all available macOS software updates, including
https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201222[security updates] and the
background updates described in this article.

Background updates include security-configuration updates and system
data files, which are automatically installed by default. They don't
cause your Mac to restart, but some only take effect after you restart.

Background updates include:

* link:#secconfigupdates[Security-configuration updates], which help
make your Mac more secure by identifying malicious software and
preventing its installation. When you restart your Mac, these updates
also remove any malicious software that is identified but already
installed.
* link:#systemdatafiles[System data files], which provide new word
lists, speech-recognition assets, voice assets, better suggestions for
contacts and events, and more. Some system data files are only installed
when you turn on or use features that require them.

To make sure that you always get these background updates promptly, keep
the “Install system data files and security updates” setting enabled in
Software Update preferences. Go to System Preferences > Software Update,
then click Advanced.
