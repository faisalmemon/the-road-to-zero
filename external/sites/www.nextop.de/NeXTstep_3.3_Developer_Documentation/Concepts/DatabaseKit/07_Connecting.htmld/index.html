<p>

<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0>

<tr valign=top>

<td width=106></td>

<td><font face="Times">The simplest way to connect your DBDatabase object to the underlying server is to pass YES as the second argument to <b>findDatabaseNamed:connect:</b>.&nbsp; The method attempts a connection to the server using the DBDatabase object's default adaptor name and login string values as guides.&nbsp; The adaptor will almost certainly put up its login panel with all but the password field filled in, thus allowing the user to supply the password.&nbsp; See the section &quot;Suppressing the Login Panel,&quot; below, if you're creating an application that doesn't use windows, or if you want to control the login information yourself.</font>

<p><font face="Times">The <b>connect</b> method follows the connection rules used by <b>findDatabaseNamed:connect:</b>.&nbsp; Specifically, it attempts a connection using the default adaptor name and login string information.&nbsp; You should only need to use the <b>connect</b> method if you've passed NO as the second argument to <b>findDatabaseNamed:connect:</b>.</font>

<p><font face="Times">The <b>connectUsingAdaptor:andString:</b> is the &quot;master&quot; connection method.&nbsp; It lets you specify the adaptor name and login string as arguments.&nbsp; If the connection is successful, the method sets the current adaptor and login settings to the arguments that you passed (the default settings aren't changed).&nbsp; In general, you should only need to use this method if you want to specify a non-default login string.&nbsp; An attempt to connect through the &quot;wrong&quot; adaptor--in other words, through an adaptor other than that upon which the model was based--is almost certain to fail.</font>

<p><br><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Disconnecting</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">To disconnect a DBDatabase, you can send it a <b>disconnect</b> or <b>disconnectUsingString:</b> message.&nbsp; The argument to the latter is a string that contains an arbitrary statement that's evaluated by the adaptor just before the connection is severed.&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, an application's connection is automatically severed when the application itself is terminated.</font>

<p><font face="Times">You should note that you can't disconnect a DBDatabase by passing NO as the second argument to the <b>findDatabaseNamed:connect:</b> method.&nbsp; If the object that's found by the method is already connected, it will remain connected regardless of the second argument value that you pass.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Because connecting to a server can be time-consuming, many application never explicitly disconnect:&nbsp; They connect when they're launched and remain connected thereafter.&nbsp; However, connection &quot;contexts&quot; can be precious commodities.&nbsp; Many server licenses allow only a certain number of connections at a time.&nbsp; In such a case, disconnecting when your application isn't actively moving data to or from the server may be the expedient thing to do if connections are limited.</font>

<p><br><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Connection State</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">To determine if a DBDatabase object is currently connected to its server, you send it an <b>isConnected</b> message.&nbsp; In reply, the method returns a boolean value.</font>

<p><font face="Times">The <b>connect</b> and&nbsp; <b>connectUsingAdaptor:andString:</b> methods also return booleans that can mistakenly be taken to indicate connection status.&nbsp; But don't be fooled:&nbsp; The value tells you whether a particular invocation of one of these methods successfully formed a connection.&nbsp; If, for example, a DBDatabase is already connected when it receives a <b>connect</b> message, the return value for the message will be NO (and the object will remain connected).</font></td></tr>

<td><font face="Times">If you're creating a command line program--or any application that doesn't use windows--then you certainly won't want the adaptor to put up its login panel.&nbsp; To suppress the panel, you send your DBDatabase object a <b>setPanelsEnabled:</b> message, passing NO as the argument, <i>before</i> you tell it to connect.&nbsp; Obviously, this means that you also have to pass NO as the second argument to the previous&nbsp; <b>findDatabaseNamed:connect:</b> method, as shown in the following example:</font></td></tr>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Attention Panels</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">The adaptor's login panel isn't the only window that a DBDatabase may cause to be displayed.&nbsp; The DBDatabase itself, by default, displays an attention panel when a server error is encountered.&nbsp; For example, if an attempted connection fails, the following panel (or one like it) will appear:</font></td></tr>
