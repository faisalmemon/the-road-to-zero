<td><font face="Times">Object-oriented programming, like most interesting new developments, builds on some old ideas, extends them, and puts them together in novel ways.&nbsp; The result is a clear step forward for the art of programming.&nbsp; An object-oriented approach makes programs more intuitive to design, faster to develop, more amenable to modification, and easier to understand.&nbsp; It leads not only to new ways of constructing programs, but also to new ways of conceiving the programming task.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Nevertheless, object-oriented programming presents some formidable obstacles to those who would like to understand what it's all about or begin trying it out.&nbsp; It introduces a new way of doing things that may seem strange at first, and it comes with an extensive terminology that can take some getting used to.&nbsp; The terminology will help in the end, but it's not always easy to learn. Moreover, there are as yet few full-fledged object-oriented development environments available to try out.&nbsp; It can be difficult to get started.</font>

<p><font face="Times">That's where this book comes in.&nbsp; It's designed to help you become familiar with object-oriented programming and get over the hurdle its terminology presents.&nbsp; It spells out some of the implications of object-oriented design and tries to give you a flavor of what writing an object-oriented program is really like.&nbsp; It fully documents the Objective C language, an object-oriented programming language based on standard C, and introduces the most extensive object-oriented development environment currently available--NEXTSTEP</font><font size="-2"><sup><sup>TM</sup></sup></font><font face="Times">.</font>

<td><font face="Times">NEXTSTEP comes with an extensive library.&nbsp; It includes several software kits containing definitions for objects that you can use &quot;off the shelf&quot; or adapt to your program's needs.&nbsp; The kits include the Application Kit</font><font size="-2"><sup><sup>TM</sup></sup></font><font face="Times">for building a graphical user interface, the Database Kit</font><font size="-2"><sup><sup>TM</sup></sup></font><font face="Times">for interacting with a database server, the 3D Graphics Kit</font><font size="-2"><sup><sup>TM</sup></sup></font><font face="Times">for constructing and manipulating three-dimensional images, the Sound Kit</font><font size="-2"><sup><sup>TM</sup></sup></font><font face="Times">for recording, editing, and playing sounds, and others.&nbsp; All these kits, and more, are documented in the <i>NEXTSTEP General Reference</i>.</font>

<p><font face="Times">NEXTSTEP also includes some exceptional development tools for putting together applications.&nbsp; There's Interface Builder</font><font size="-2"><sup><sup>TM</sup></sup></font><font face="Times">, a program that lets you design an application graphically and assemble its user interface on-screen, and Project Builder, a project-management program that provides graphical access to the compiler, the debugger, documentation, a program editor, and other tools.&nbsp; These programs are documented in <i>NEXTSTEP Development Tools and Techniques</i>.</font>

<p><font face="Times">This book is about the third component of the development environment--the programming language.&nbsp; All NEXTSTEP software kits are written in the Objective C language.&nbsp; To get the benefit of the kits, applications must also use Objective C.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Objective C is implemented as set of extensions to the C language.&nbsp; It's designed to give C a full capability for object-oriented programming, and to do so in a simple and straightforward way.&nbsp; Its additions to C are few and are mostly based on Smalltalk, one of the first object-oriented programming languages.</font>

<p><font face="Times">This book both introduces the object-oriented model that Objective C is based upon and fully documents the language.&nbsp; It concentrates on the Objective C extensions to C, not on the C language itself.&nbsp; There are many good books available on C; this manual doesn't attempt to duplicate them.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Because this isn't a book about C, it assumes some prior acquaintance with that language.&nbsp; However, it doesn't have to be an extensive acquaintance.&nbsp; Object-oriented programming in Objective C is sufficiently different from procedural programming in standard C that you won't be hampered if you're not an experienced C programmer.</font></td></tr>

<tr valign=top>

<td width=106></td>

<td><font face="Times">The Objective C language was chosen for the NEXTSTEP development environment for a variety of reasons.&nbsp; First and foremost, it's an object-oriented language.&nbsp; The kind of functionality that's packaged in the NEXTSTEP software kits can only be delivered through object-oriented techniques.&nbsp; This manual will explain how the kits work and why this is the case.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Second, because Objective C is an extension of standard ANSI C, existing C programs can be adapted to use the software kits without losing any of the work that went into their original development.&nbsp; Since Objective C incorporates C, you get all the benefits of C when working within Objective C.&nbsp; You can choose when to do something in an object-oriented way (define a new class, for example) and when to stick to procedural programming techniques (define a structure and some functions instead of a class).</font>

<p><font face="Times">Moreover, Objective C is a simple language.&nbsp; Its syntax is small, unambiguous, and easy to learn.&nbsp; Object-oriented programming, with its self-conscious terminology and emphasis on abstract design, often presents a steep learning curve to new recruits.&nbsp; A well-organized language like Objective C can make becoming a proficient object-oriented programmer that much less difficult.&nbsp; The size of this manual is a testament to the simplicity of Objective C.&nbsp; It's not a big book--and Objective C is fully documented in just two of its chapters.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Objective C is the most dynamic of the object-oriented languages based on C.&nbsp; The compiler throws very little away, so a great deal of information is preserved for use at run time.&nbsp; Decisions that otherwise might be made at compile time can be postponed until the program is running.&nbsp; This gives Objective C programs unusual flexibility and power.&nbsp; For example, Objective C's dynamism yields two big benefits that are hard to get with other nominally object-oriented languages:</font></td></tr>

<td><font face="Times">Objective C supports an open style of dynamic binding, a style than can accommodate a simple architecture for interactive user interfaces.&nbsp; Messages are not necessarily constrained by either the class of the receiver or the method selector, so a software kit can allow for user choices at run time and permit developers freedom of expression in their design. (Terminology like &quot;dynamic binding,&quot; &quot;message,&quot; &quot;class,&quot; &quot;receiver,&quot; and &quot;selector&quot; will be explained in due course in this manual.)</font></td></tr>

<td><font face="Times">Objective C's dynamism enables the construction of sophisticated development tools.&nbsp; An interface to the run-time system provides access to information about running applications, so it's possible to develop tools that monitor, intervene, and reveal the underlying structure and activity of Objective C applications.&nbsp; Interface Builder could not have been developed with a less dynamic language.&nbsp; (The full interface to the run-time system is documented in the <i>NEXTSTEP General Reference </i>manual.)</font></td></tr>
