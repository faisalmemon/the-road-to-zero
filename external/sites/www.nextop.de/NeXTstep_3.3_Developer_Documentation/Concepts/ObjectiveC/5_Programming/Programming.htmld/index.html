<td><font face="Times">Using a library of kit classes differs somewhat from using a library of C functions.&nbsp; You can pretty much pick and choose which library functions to use and when to use them depending on the program you're designing.&nbsp; A kit, on the other hand, imposes a design on your program (at least on the part the kit is concerned with).&nbsp; When you use a kit, you'll find yourself relying on library methods to do much of the work of the program.&nbsp; To customize the kit and adapt it to your needs, you'll implement methods that the kit will invoke at the appropriate time.&nbsp; These kit-designated methods are &quot;hooks&quot; where your own code can be introduced into the kit design.&nbsp; In a sense, the usual roles of program and library are reversed.&nbsp; Instead of incorporating library code into the program, program code is incorporated into the kit.</font>

<p><font face="Times">This chapter discusses what it's like to write an Objective C program, especially one based on a software kit.&nbsp; It discusses some of the programming techniques that come into play, and, as an example, explains something of how the NEXTSTEP Application Kit works.&nbsp; The final section takes up the question of combining Objective C with C++.</font></td></tr>

<td><font face="Times">Most NEXTSTEP applications belong in this last category.&nbsp; They display windows and menus on-screen, and may have various kinds of buttons to click, text fields to type into, icons to drag, and other control devices to manipulate.&nbsp; Such an interface invites user actions on the keyboard and mouse.</font>

<p><font face="Times">The core group of objects that <b>main()</b> sets up must include some that draw the user interface, and <b>main()</b> must make sure that at least part of this interface--perhaps just a menu--is placed on-screen.&nbsp; (This typically is taken care of as a by-product of loading core objects from an Interface Builder archive.)</font>

<p><font face="Times">Once the initial interface is on-screen, the application will be driven not by command-line arguments or even remote messages, but by external <i>events</i>, most notably user actions on the keyboard and mouse.&nbsp; For example, when the user clicks a menu item, two events are generated--a mouse-down event when the mouse button is pressed and a mouse-up event when the button is released again.&nbsp; Similarly, typing on the keyboard generates key-down and key-up events, moving the mouse with a button pressed generates mouse-dragged events, and so on.&nbsp; Each event is reported to the application with a good deal of information about the circumstances of the user action--for example, which key or mouse button was pressed, where the cursor was located, and which window was affected.</font>

<p><font face="Times">An application gets an event, looks at it, responds to it, then waits for another event.&nbsp; It keeps getting one event after another, as long as the user produces them.&nbsp; From the time it's launched to the time it terminates, almost everything the application does will derive from user actions in the form of events.</font>

<p><font face="Times">The mechanism for getting and responding to events is the <i>main event loop</i> (called &quot;main&quot; because an application can also set up subordinate event loops for brief periods of time).&nbsp; One object in the core group has responsibility for running the main event loop--getting an event, generating a message that initiates the application's response to the event, then getting (or waiting for) the next event.</font>

<p><font face="Times">The Application Kit defines an object to do this work; it's an instance of the Application class and is assigned to the global variable NXApp.&nbsp; After creating this object (and other objects in the core framework), the <b>main()</b> function sends it a <b>run </b>message:</font></td></tr>

<p><font face="Times">While in the main event loop, an application can also receive input from other sources.&nbsp; For example, a music application might receive input from a MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) keyboard, an application that's hooked up to a telephone line might receive data over the line, and almost any application might receive remote messages from other applications.&nbsp; This kind of remote input is scheduled between events.&nbsp; In some cases (MIDI, for example), it might far outweigh user activity on the computer keyboard and mouse.</font></td></tr>

<td><font face="Times">Library functions impose few restrictions on the programs that use them; they can be called whenever they're needed.&nbsp; The methods in an object-oriented library, on the other hand, are tied to class definitions and can't be used unless you create an object that has access to them.&nbsp; The object must be connected to at least one other object in the program so that it can operate in the program network.&nbsp; A class defines a program component; to avail yourself of its services, you need to craft it into the structure of your application.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Nevertheless, for some classes, using a library object is pretty much the same as using a library function, though on a grander scale.&nbsp; You can simply create an instance, initialize it, and insert it into an awaiting slot in your application.&nbsp; For example, NEXTSTEP includes a HashTable class that provides a hashing service that you can take advantage of as needed.</font>

<p><font face="Times">In general, however, object-oriented libraries contain more than single classes that offer individual services.&nbsp; They contain kits, collections of classes that structure a problem space and present an integrated solution to it.&nbsp; Instead of providing services that you use as needed, a kit provides an entire program structure, a framework, that your own code must adapt to.&nbsp; It's a generic program model that you specialize to the requirements of your particular application.&nbsp; Rather than design a program that you plug library functions into, you plug your own code into the design provided by the kit.</font>

<p><br><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Inheriting from Kit Classes</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">A kit defines a program framework that many different kinds of applications can share.&nbsp; Since the framework is generic, it's not surprising that some kit classes are incomplete or abstract.&nbsp; A class can often do most of the work in low-level and common code, but nevertheless will require application-specific additions.</font>

<p><font face="Times">These additions are made in subclasses of the kit class.&nbsp; The point of defining a subclass is to fill in pieces the kit class is missing.&nbsp; This is done by implementing a specific set of methods.&nbsp; The kit designer declares these methods, sometimes in a protocol, but typically in the kit class itself.&nbsp; The subclass simply overrides the kit version of the methods.</font>

<p><br><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica"><b>Implementing Your Own Version of a Method</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">Most methods defined in a kit class are fully implemented; they exist so that you can invoke the services the class provides.&nbsp; In some cases, these methods should never be changed by the application.&nbsp; The kit depends on them doing just what they do--nothing more and nothing less.&nbsp; In other cases, the methods can be overridden, but there's no real reason to do so.&nbsp; The kit's version does the job.&nbsp; But, just as you might implement your own version of a string comparison function rather than use <b>strcmp()</b>, you can choose to override the kit method if you want to.</font>

<p><font face="Times">However, a few kit methods are designed to be overridden; they exist so that you can add specific behavior to the kit.&nbsp; Often, the kit-defined method will do little or nothing that's of use to your application, but will appear in messages initiated by other methods.&nbsp; To give content to the method, your application must implement its own version.</font>

<p><font face="Times">New instances of a subclass are ready to take their place in the network of objects the kit defines.&nbsp; They inherit the ability to work with other objects from the kit.&nbsp; For example, if you define a Cell subclass, instances of the new class will be able to connect with a Matrix just like ButtonCells, TextFieldCells, and other kinds of kit-defined Cell objects.</font>

<p><font face="Times">The kit superclass defines a set of outlet connections to other objects and provides a mechanism for setting those connections, sometimes automatically.&nbsp; Instances of the subclass fit into the kit framework as if they were defined in the kit.</font>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Connecting to Kit Objects</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">A kit framework can never be complete.&nbsp; It can cover much of the terrain, but it can't anticipate all the details of every application or what additional structure they'll need.&nbsp; Therefore, kits generally provide ways for you to hook your own objects up to kit objects.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Notifications after the fact allow the delegate to coordinate other activities with the actions of the kit object, but they don't give the delegate any control over the kit.&nbsp; For example, a Window object's delegate receives <b>windowDidResize:</b> messages after the user resizes the window.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Prior notifications permit the same kind of coordination, but in addition may give the delegate a chance to approve or disapprove of the impending action, or to modify it in some way.&nbsp; For example, a Window sends its delegate <b>windowWillResize:toSize: </b>messages as the user drags an outline of the window to resize it.&nbsp; The message gives the delegate a chance to constrain the size of the window.</font>

<p><font face="Times">True delegation messages, those that assign a specific responsibility to the delegate, use a different naming scheme.&nbsp; The methods that respond to these messages are, like most methods, named for what the method is supposed to do, not for what the kit did.&nbsp; For example, a kit object might send a <b>browser:loadCell:atRow:inColumn:</b> message to its delegate when it needs data to display in a browser on-screen, or an <b>app:openFile:type:</b> message when it needs help in opening a file.</font>

<p><br><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica"><b>Other Kit Outlets</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">Assigning a delegate is just one way of making a connection to a kit object.&nbsp; In the Application Kit, for example, you can also assign owners to Pasteboard objects and targets to control devices (button, sliders, and the like).&nbsp; These different kinds of connections--delegates, targets, owners, and others--name the various kinds of outlet connections that kit objects maintain to the objects you invent.&nbsp; Each specifies the kind of role your object will play in the kit design.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Different kinds of outlets have different responsibilities.&nbsp; The pasteboard's owner, for example, is responsible for providing data when it's needed for a Paste operation.&nbsp; A target is entrusted with carrying out the command of a control device.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Each kit defines its own group of outlets, plus the methods for setting them.&nbsp; Outlets often can be set graphically within Interface Builder while programming the user interface.&nbsp; Although there are <b>setDelegate:</b> and <b>setTarget:</b> methods, for example, delegates and targets are almost always set in Interface Builder.</font></td></tr>

<td><font face="Times">These can be formidable tasks.&nbsp; While easy and intuitive for the user, an interactive graphical interface can be quite intricate from the programmer's perspective.&nbsp; They demand a lot of time and a lot of code.</font>

<p><font face="Times">The Application Kit is designed to reduce this effort.&nbsp; The Kit takes over much of the user-interface work, so your application doesn't need to be concerned with it at all.&nbsp; For example, it provides ready-made windows and a set of software control devices with built-in code for drawing and responding to user actions.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Of course, the Kit can't handle every user action or do all the drawing.&nbsp; If it did, there would be no way for you to develop an application--to put your own interpretation on input from the user or put your own output on the screen.&nbsp; The goal of the Kit is not to constrain what an application can do, but to set up a structure that makes it easy for it to draw and interpret user input. The Kit assumes most of the low-level burden of these tasks, while allowing you complete freedom to construct any kind of interactive application you want.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Since getting user input and providing drawing output are fundamental to the design of an application, the way the Kit structures these tasks becomes the core of a basic program structure for the entire application.&nbsp; This structure is built around the event cycle.</font>

<p><br><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>The Event Cycle</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">NEXTSTEPapplications are controlled by the actions of the user on the keyboard and mouse.&nbsp; These actions are reported to the application as <i>events</i>--discrete packets of information that record what the user did along with other relevant information (such as where the cursor was located at the time and which window was affected).&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, a key-down event is generated when the user presses a key on the keyboard, and a key-up event when the key is released again.&nbsp; Mouse-down, mouse-dragged, and mouse-up events are generated when the user presses a mouse button, moves the cursor on-screen with the button down, and then releases the button.&nbsp; Each event records one atomic user action.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Almost everything the application does, it does on direct instructions from the user in the form of events.&nbsp; This is what's meant when it's said that an application is &quot;driven by events&quot;--the user drives the application.&nbsp; An application can choose just what events it wants to receive and just how to react to them, but the cycle of getting an event, responding to it, then getting another event is universal.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Applications invite user actions by the graphical user interface they draw on-screen.&nbsp; An empty text field with a blinking caret, for example, lets the user know it's appropriate to enter text.&nbsp; A button or menu command solicits a click.&nbsp; The knob of a scroller looks like something that might be grabbed and moved along the bar.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Once the user acts and an event is received, an application must draw again to keep up its end of the conversation with the user--to provide a visible response to the user's actions.&nbsp; It's useful, in fact, to think of applications drawing for three overlapping reasons, all of them related to the cycle of getting and responding to events.&nbsp; An application draws:</font></td></tr>

<p><font face="Times">At start up, every NEXTSTEP application establishes a connection to the Window Server.&nbsp; The application and the Server run independently of each other, but maintain a two-way communication channel.&nbsp; As the application runs, it requests the windows it needs, and the Server provides them.&nbsp; Each client application has an independent operating context within the Server and its own set of windows.</font>

<p><font face="Times">All of a client application's drawing output is confined within window boundaries; it's impossible to draw directly on-screen outside a window.&nbsp; So the application presents itself--its user interface--within windows, and users do their work within windows.&nbsp; It's natural, therefore, for windows to be the focus of user actions.&nbsp; Consequently, the Window Server plays a principal role for both drawing output and event input:</font></td></tr>

<td><font face="Times">An application responds to these other types of input between events.&nbsp; When it's time to get the next event, the application first checks whether any remote messages have been received, any data is waiting at a monitored port or file, or it's time to call a timed entry.&nbsp; If so, the next event (if one is waiting) can be postponed.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Each additional source of input has an assigned priority.&nbsp; The choice of what to respond to next is made by weighing the various priorities against the threshold importance of getting the next event.&nbsp; If an event and a remote message are both waiting for a response, the application could pick the remote message first and postpone the event, or do it the other way around and pick the event first.&nbsp; For example, while in a modal event loop, an application might not want to be interrupted by a remote message that it would be willing to receive between events in the main event loop.&nbsp; Once your application sets the priorities, the Application Kit manages this decision-making process for you.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Events are the most important input for almost all applications, both because they're generally more common than the other types of input and because they convey instructions directly from the user.</font>

<p><font face="Times">But, like events, the other types of input are also usually due to user activity; they indirectly derive from events.&nbsp; A remote message is typically prompted by an event in another application, data is received at monitored ports and files due to user activity elsewhere, and a timed entry is usually registered because of the events the application receives.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Every window the user sees on-screen is managed by a separate Window object.&nbsp; At the lowest level, windows are implemented by the Window Server.&nbsp; Generally, when a new Window object is created, the Server produces the window it will manage.&nbsp; However, to conserve memory and reduce start-up time, you can delay creating the window until it's placed on-screen; you can also arrange for the Window object to destroy the window when it's removed from the screen and get a new one when it's needed again.&nbsp; So it's possible for a Window object to be temporarily without a window and to be paired, at various times, with a variety of different window devices.&nbsp; The object corresponds to the user's conception of a window, not necessarily to its lower-level implementation.</font>

<p><font face="Times">The Window object takes care of drawing the window's title bar and frame, and it responds to user actions that move the window, miniaturize and close it.&nbsp; It handles all window-specific communication with the Window Server.</font>

<p><font face="Times">You give content to a Window by assigning it Views.&nbsp; Each Window contains a set of hierarchically arranged Views; you can place a View anywhere in the hierarchy.&nbsp; At the top of the hierarchy is the <i>content view</i>, which fills the entire content area of the window inside the frame and title bar.&nbsp; Other Views are in charge of smaller areas (such as a particular text field or scroller), or larger areas (such as an entire document) that are clipped to the visible area within the window.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Like the Application object, Windows can be taken off-the-shelf and used without subclassing, though you might define a subclass of Panel (Window's subclass) to set up a particular kind of panel.&nbsp; To connect any Window object (including a Panel, a Menu, or a PopUpList) with application-specific code, you can assign it a delegate.&nbsp; Other kinds of Windows inherit the ability to have a delegate from the Window class.</font>

<p><font face="Times">The Application Kit defines off-the-shelf Views in each group--the Text object in the first group, Matrix, Form, and other controls in the second, and ScrollView, ClipView, and others in the third.&nbsp; However, most programs need to add to these objects with their own customized View subclasses.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Unlike Windows and the Application object, Views don't have delegates (though you could implement a View subclass that had one).&nbsp; Since you must define a View subclass to hold application-specific code anyway, any coordinating code that would otherwise be placed in the delegate can go in the subclass instead.</font>

<p><br><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Fitting into the Event Cycle</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">The Application, Window, and View classes set up a basic framework for handling the application's end of the event cycle. The application must fill in this framework by giving it specific drawing and event-handling content.&nbsp; You may also need to coordinate the activities of your own objects with the objects defined in the kit.</font>

<p><br><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica"><b>Handling Events</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">Events are delivered to Views in messages named after the event.&nbsp; For example, a mouse-down event is delivered as a <b>mouseDown:</b> message and a key-down event as a <b>keyDown:</b> message.&nbsp; Each message carries a pointer to a record of the event (a structure of type NXEvent).</font>

<p><font face="Times">To handle an event, a View must have a method that can respond to the <i>event message</i> that delivers it.&nbsp; Since each application, and each kind of View, responds to events differently, the implementation of these methods is left to View subclasses.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Methods that respond to event messages sometimes set up modal event loops.&nbsp; For example, to coordinate a mouse-down event with the subsequent mouse-up event, or to track the cursor while the user holds the mouse button down, a <b>mouseDown:</b> method might get mouse-dragged and mouse-up events directly from the Application object.&nbsp; The modal loop is broken when the mouse-up event arrives.&nbsp; Such a method might look something like this:</font></td></tr>

<td><font face="Times">Briefly, this method responds to a mouse-down event by resetting the window's event mask to include mouse-dragged events.&nbsp; It then sets up a subordinate event loop that looks only for mouse-dragged and mouse-up events.&nbsp; While waiting for the mouse-up event that will break the loop, it tracks the position of the cursor through the mouse-dragged events it receives.&nbsp; (All of the programming elements used in this example are defined in the Application Kit and documented in the <i>NEXTSTEP General Reference</i>.)</font>

<p><font face="Times">Such a method might respond to a click by first highlighting the image that was clicked (on the mouse-down event) then taking the required action (on the mouse-up event).&nbsp; Or it might continually update the position of an image the user is dragging, or highlight a range of text as the user drags over it.</font>

<p><font face="Times">The Application Kit's event-handling mechanism makes sure the event message gets to the View.&nbsp; All the View subclass needs to do is implement the method.</font>

<p><br><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica"><b>Drawing</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">Views draw at two different times and in two different ways.&nbsp; They draw proactively to present themselves to the user (that is, to present what the display within the View rectangle currently looks like) and reactively in response to events.&nbsp; Reactive drawing is temporary--the highlighting of a button while the cursor is over it or of text as the user drags across it.&nbsp; It gives immediate feedback to the user.&nbsp; Proactive drawing is more permanent.&nbsp; It can change as the result of events, of course, but it doesn't track the user's action.</font>

<p><font face="Times">For example, as the user drags to select a range of text, the amount of highlighted text changes as the cursor moves.&nbsp; This drawing reacts to the movement of the cursor as reported in mouse-dragged events.&nbsp; When the user releases the mouse button to finish the selection, the text stays highlighted.&nbsp; The highlighting has become an inherent part of the text display (at least until the next event), and part of what the View will proactively present when asked to display itself.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Reactive drawing happens in methods that respond to event messages, such as the <b>mouseDown:</b> method illustrated above. Proactive drawing happens as the result of display messages.&nbsp; A View can be asked to display its contents at any time.&nbsp; For example, a View that draws editable text would receive a display message when its window first comes on-screen.&nbsp; Later it might receive display messages when the text is scrolled, after the user makes some editing changes, or when the image is magnified.</font>

<p><font face="Times">The Application Kit's display mechanism makes sure that Views receive display messages when they need to refresh their images on-screen.&nbsp; However the Kit can't know what image to draw.&nbsp; To do the actual drawing, a display message invokes the <b>drawSelf::</b> method of each View being displayed.&nbsp; Every View is required to supply its own <b>drawSelf::</b> method to proactively present itself to the user.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Before sending a <b>drawSelf::</b> message to a View, the Kit brings the View into focus (makes its coordinate system the current coordinate system for drawing).&nbsp; The message itself passes the View two arguments specifying the regions where it's expected to draw.&nbsp; These regions might be smaller that the View rectangle; by paying attention to them, <b>drawSelf::</b> can avoid generating unneeded drawing instructions.</font>

<p><font face="Times">A View can draw using wrapped PostScript code, as discussed earlier under &quot;The Window Server,&quot; or it can use the imaging facilities provided in the NXImage class, or even draw in three dimensions using the 3D Graphics Kit.&nbsp; The 3D Kit defines a framework for building 3D images and presenting them within a View.</font>

<p><font face="Times">A View can also divide its drawing area into small sections and put another object in charge of each section.&nbsp; This is exactly what a Matrix does; it uses Cell objects to draw and handle events for it.&nbsp; A Matrix is a kind of View, so it can take care of all external relations--positioning itself relative to other Views, getting events, setting up a coordinate system for drawing, and so on.&nbsp; The Cells take care of internal matters.&nbsp; When the Matrix receives a display message, its <b>drawSelf::</b> method sends <b>drawSelf:inView:</b> messages to the Cells.&nbsp; When it gets a mouse-down event, its <b>mouseDown:</b> method tracks the cursor over the Cells and informs the Cell the cursor is pointing to.</font>

<p><br><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica"><b>Controls</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">Event messages deliver the user's instructions directly to Views.&nbsp; However, because events are closely tied to hardware devices--the keyboard and mouse--there can be but a handful of different event types.&nbsp; Events alone don't give an application much information about the user's intentions.</font>

<p><font face="Times">The user interface, therefore, needs to establish well-understood paradigms for interpreting events.&nbsp; In text, for example, a key-down event for a backspace deletes the previous character, other key-down events insert characters into the stream of text, double-clicking selects a word, and so on.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Graphical user interfaces often borrow paradigms from the real world by emulating hardware devices in software.&nbsp; It's not possible (or at least not very practical) to attach a lot of control panels with buttons, knobs, sliders and other devices to the computer alongside the keyboard and mouse.&nbsp; But it is possible to provide those controls on the screen where they can be manipulated indirectly through mouse and keyboard events.</font>

<p><font face="Times">It's the job of software control devices to interpret events and ask other objects to respond to them.&nbsp; Graphically, a control presents the user with an image of a recognizable device that can be manipulated with the keyboard and mouse--a button that can be pressed, a slider with a knob that can be dragged, a text field where data can be entered.&nbsp; Functionally, it translates the event messages it receives into application-specific <i>action messages</i> for another object.&nbsp; The object that receives an action message is the control's <i>target</i>.</font>

<p><font face="Times">The Application Kit defines several standard control devices.&nbsp; Most are implemented as Views, others as Panels.&nbsp; In a Matrix, each ButtonCell or SliderCell might be thought of as a separate control, or the whole Matrix might act as an independent control device.</font>

<p><font face="Times">The Kit lets you set the target of a control,</font></td></tr>

<p><font face="Times">Action messages take a single argument, the <b>id</b> of the object that sends the message.&nbsp; If a target needs more information to accurately respond to an action message, it can send a message back to the control requesting the information it needs.&nbsp; For example, if a target receives a <b>changeName:</b> message from a Matrix, it can send a <b>stringValue</b> message back to the Matrix to find the name the user selected.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Assigning a target and action message to a control device gives it specific meaning.&nbsp; It's something like buying a generic switch at the hardware store and hooking it up to a particular piece of equipment in your home.&nbsp; Using kit-defined controls, you can assemble most of your application's user interface from off-the-shelf objects.&nbsp; The objects you design to do the basic work of your application can be connected to the user interface by being made targets of controls.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Interface Builder lets you set targets and actions graphically.&nbsp; You can name your own action methods while you design the user interface, then implement the methods later.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Much of the activity of an application centers on the Application object, which represents the application as a whole, and on Window objects, which represent each of the windows the application uses.&nbsp; To coordinate other parts of the program with these objects, you can assign them a delegate and implement methods that the Application and Window classes declare in informal protocols.&nbsp; You can select which messages you want the delegate to receive; a message is sent only if the delegate implements a method that can respond.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Most methods implemented by Window and Application delegates respond to simple notifications.&nbsp; For example, when the user moves a window, the Window's delegate can be notified with a <b>windowDidMove:</b> message.&nbsp; Applications mostly don't care where their windows are located on-screen, but they can take note of the new location by implementing this method.</font>

<p><font face="Times">When the window becomes the key window (the window the user is about to work in and the one marked by a black title bar), the delegate is sent a <b>windowDidBecomeKey:</b> message, and when another window takes over as key window, it gets a <b>windowDidResignKey:</b> message.&nbsp; The Window object takes care of all the required changes when a window gains and loses key-window status (such as bringing the window to the front of the screen and highlighting and unhighlighting its title bar), but the delegate can take note of these status changes by implementing these methods.</font>

<p><font face="Times">The Application object can send its delegate a variety of messages.&nbsp; Many are pure notifications.&nbsp; For example, just after it finishes all its initialization tasks and before it enters the main event loop, the Application object sends its delegate an <b>appDidInit:</b> message.&nbsp; When the application becomes the active application (the one the user is about to work in), the delegate is sent an <b>appDidBecomeActive:</b> message and, if it was hidden, an <b>appDidUnhide:</b> message.&nbsp; When the application is hidden (its windows removed from the screen), the delegate is sent an <b>appDidHide:</b> message and an <b>appDidUnhide:</b> message when it returns to the screen. When the user quits the application, the delegate gets an <b>appWillTerminate:</b> message.</font>

<p><font face="Times">These messages give you a chance to coordinate with user actions.&nbsp; For example, <b>appDidInit:</b> could open an empty window for the user to work in, if the application normally opens and displays a file but the user launched it by double-clicking an application icon rather than a file icon.&nbsp; If quitting would destroy some of the user's work, <b>appWillTerminate:</b> could put up an attention panel reminding the user of that fact, then return <b>nil</b> to prevent the termination if the user cancels the Quit command.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Some messages to the Application object's delegate assign it specific tasks.&nbsp; For example, if the application receives a remote message asking it to open a particular file, the Application object will determine whether the application is able to open another file and, if it is, find the file and pass its pathname to its delegate in an <b>app:openFile:type:</b> message.&nbsp; The Application object can't itself open the file and display its contents in a window.&nbsp; Different applications store their data differently.&nbsp; Being generic, the Application Kit can't know about application-specific data formats and conventions.&nbsp; Therefore, when it receives a request to open a file, it sends its delegate an <b>app:openFile:type:</b> message.&nbsp; The delegate can implement this method to open the file, create a Window and a View, and display the contents of the file on-screen.</font>

<td><font face="Times">It shouldn't be surprising, therefore, to find a group of classes that have differing, and alternative, implementations of the same interface.&nbsp; Each implementation is optimized for a different set of circumstances.&nbsp; Instead of a program component being implemented in just one class, it's implemented in a cluster of classes.</font>

<p><font face="Times">To keep differences between classes in the cluster a matter of implementation only, it's important that they all share the same interface.&nbsp; Typically, all the implementing classes are grouped under an abstract class that declares their common interface. Program users can regard an instance of any class in the cluster as if it was an instance of the abstract class.</font>

<p><font face="Times">A cluster of classes can be used to optimize data storage.&nbsp; Suppose, for example, that your program will make extensive use of an object with a long list of instance variables.&nbsp; Some variables will be used frequently, but many are for specialized situations that rarely come up.&nbsp; Perhaps some variables declared as <b>double</b>s will most often hold small integers, but they must be declared as floating point numbers for the exceptional case.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Moreover, because there will be many instances of this kind of object in your program, you're concerned with the amount of memory they'll consume.</font>

<p><font face="Times">In this circumstance, you might save memory by implementing a cluster of classes instead of a single class.&nbsp; An abstract class would declare a common interface that all its subclasses would adhere to; it would declare no instance variables of its own. One subclass could declare a small subset of instance variables sufficient to handle simple cases.&nbsp; It would have <b>char</b>s or <b>short</b>s instead of <b>double</b>s and avoid some of the more esoteric fields that would be infrequently used.&nbsp; Other subclasses could be optimized for special circumstances.&nbsp; One subclass, of course, would have to provide the full set of instance variables that you originally contemplated.&nbsp; Each subclass would override superclass methods and implement them in a way that's appropriate for its particular kind of data storage.</font>

<p><font face="Times">A cluster of classes can also be used to optimize methods for different patterns of usage.&nbsp; For example, suppose that you want to define an interface for data storage and retrieval.&nbsp; The way you'd implement the methods would vary depending on the anticipated size of the data elements and the number being stored.&nbsp; In this circumstance, you could provide more than one implementation of the interface, optimizing each for a particular size and amount of data.</font>

<p><font face="Times">The choice of which implementation (which subclass in the cluster) to use can be handled in a variety of ways.&nbsp; Allocation and initialization methods in the superclass might choose the subclass that best fits the circumstances and create an instance of that class--trying always for instances that occupy as little memory as possible and that have access to the most efficient algorithms for the data.</font>

<p><font face="Times">A subclass cluster obviously works best for objects that, once initialized, are rarely or never modified.&nbsp; However, if an instance ever needs to change its implementation to that of another subclass (one that can store more information, for example), the change might be made almost automatically.&nbsp; A special &quot;copy&quot; method would allocate an instance of the alternative class, initialize and return it.&nbsp; The original instance could then be freed.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Subclass clusters take to heart the idea that what matters most about an object is its method interface, not its implementation. By keeping the same interface for an assortment of alternative implementations, they serve to simplify the overall interface and make it easier to understand.&nbsp; Instead of a variety of different data-storage schemes, for example, there's just one, with a variety of different implementations.</font></td></tr>

<td><font face="Times">The Objective C language is conceived as a set of extensions to a base language, which happens to be C.&nbsp; These extensions don't alter the semantics of the base language; they simply add a few syntactic constructions to give it an object-oriented capability.&nbsp; Other programming languages may similarly be made &quot;Objective,&quot; as long as any syntactic conflicts between the base language and the extensions are properly handled.</font>

<p><font face="Times">NeXT has taken the logical step and added the Objective C extensions to C++.&nbsp; Objective C and C++ can be combined in the same source file and compiled together.&nbsp; With C++ as the base for the Objective C extensions, you can mix features from both languages, using whichever ones are appropriate for the task.&nbsp; For example, you can take advantage of Objective C's dynamic binding and still use C++'s stronger type checking and compile-time binding as needed.&nbsp; Modules using features from both languages can translate between modules written in &quot;straight&quot; C++ and Objective C code.</font>

<p><font face="Times">NeXT's primary goal in integrating the C++ and Objective C programming languages is to make it possible for you to use an existing base of C++ code with the NEXTSTEP software kits.&nbsp; You can also take advantage of this integration to write mixed code if you have a strong need for some features of the C++ language while programming in Objective C.</font>

<p><br><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Writing Mixed Code</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">NeXT's C++ compiler allows C++ and Objective C expressions to be mixed in almost any manner.&nbsp; For example, Objective C messages can be sent within the member functions of C++ classes, and C++ member functions can be called within Objective C methods.&nbsp; Objects defined in either language can create and use objects defined in the other language; a C++ class can declare an <b>id</b> as a data member, while an Objective C class can declare a C++ object as an instance variable.&nbsp; An Objective C message can pass a C++ object as an argument, and a C++ function can take an Objective C object as an argument.</font>

<p><font face="Times">However, classes defined in each languages retain their own character.&nbsp; You can't define an hybrid object.&nbsp; Objective C messages can be sent only to Objective C receivers, and C++ member functions are called only through C++ objects.&nbsp; A class defined in one language can't inherit from a class defined in the other language.&nbsp; Moreover, operators specific to C++ can't be applied to Objective C objects.&nbsp; It won't work, for example, to use the C++ <b>new</b> and <b>delete</b> operators to allocate and free Objective C objects.</font>

<p><font face="Times">When mixing C++ and Objective C code, the keywords of both languages should be respected.&nbsp; In most cases, there's no problem since both languages derive from C and most keywords are shared.&nbsp; However, the C++ keyword <b>new</b> is also a common method name in Objective C.&nbsp; To handle this potential conflict, the compiler allows an Objective C method to have the same name as a C++ keyword and decides which is which based on context.&nbsp; For example, if &quot;new&quot; appears outside square brackets, it's treated as the C++ keyword for allocation from the free store; if it appears within square brackets in the position of a message name, it's treated as such.&nbsp; It's even legal to use &quot;new&quot; within a message expression as a C++ keyword:</font></td></tr>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Bridge Classes</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">A common method of mixing C++ and Objective C code is to write most modules purely in one language or the other, and then connect them by creating compound &quot;bridge&quot; objects--one defined as an Objective C object containing a C++ object as an instance variable, and if needed, a corresponding C++ object containing an Objective C object as a data member.&nbsp; The Objective C object responds to messages by calling one of the C++ object's member functions, and the C++ object implements its member functions to send messages to its Objective C counterpart.&nbsp; If the communication must be two-way, the C++ <b>class </b>and the Objective C <b>@class</b> declarations can be used to avoid circular references in header files.</font>

<p><font face="Times">When a project is structured this way, only the bridge classes need to contain both Objective C and C++ expressions.&nbsp; This reduces the potential for conflicts and makes the rest of the source code easier to read.</font>
