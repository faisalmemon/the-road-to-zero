<tr valign=top>

<td width=105></td>

<td><font face="Times">Interface Builder displays a window that represents your application's user interface and provides graphic access to a number of standard interface objects, such as text fields, buttons, and menus.&nbsp; To design an interface, you simply drag the interface objects into your application's interface window and place them where you want them.&nbsp; You can inspect and modify an object to create a particular look--you can even give it a sound effect.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Interface objects understand user events such as mouse and keyboard actions and automatically perform basic display operations when an action is directed at them.&nbsp; For example, a button knows how to graphically highlight itself when the user clicks it, a text field displays the characters that the user types in it, a window disappears when its close button is clicked, and so on.</font>

<p><font face="Times">In addition, Interface Builder has tools for connecting interface objects to each other.&nbsp; For instance, you can connect a button to a panel such that the panel comes to the front when the user clicks the button, or you can connect a slider to a text field so that the value displayed in the text field is continuously updated as the user drags the slider's knob up and down.&nbsp; NeXT provides the code for the basic interface operations; you can also design your own objects and actions and connect them in Interface Builder.&nbsp; For some simple applications, the interface objects and the code provided by NeXT are sufficient, allowing you to create an application without writing a line of code.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Most applications, of course, require more work than simply defining an interface.&nbsp; The other facet of Interface Builder, its creation of a programming environment, makes it a good place to start a new project even if the interface is trivial compared to the amount of programming the project requires.&nbsp; Interface Builder can automatically create a UNIX</font><font size="-2"><sup>&reg;</sup></font><font face="Times"><i>makefile</i> (the script for your application's compilation routine), some basic source code, and the header files that your application needs to compile.</font>

<p><br><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>The Application Kit</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">All applications use the Application Kit regardless of their purpose and complexity.&nbsp; The buttons, sliders, and windows that you use to design an interface with Interface Builder are defined as classes in the Application Kit.&nbsp; Also, as described in the next section, it's through this Kit that your application is able to draw on the screen and receive events from the user.</font>

<p><font face="Times">The Objective-C language and the software kits make it easy to create your own class of object.&nbsp; One of the features of the language is that it supports class inheritance; this means that you can create a class that inherits the attributes of another class.&nbsp; For example, you can create a class that inherits from the Application Kit's Button class (by convention, class names are capitalized in Objective-C).&nbsp; Your version of Button will be able to do everything that the Kit version can do, plus you can add to it the specialized functionality that your application requires.</font>

<p><br><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>The NeXT Window Server</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">The NeXT Window Server is a low-level background process that creates and manipulates windows on the screen. Your application establishes a connection with the Window Server through the Application Kit and opens one or more windows.&nbsp; Windows provide a vehicle for communication between the user and the application.&nbsp; The Window Server manages this communication as it fulfills two functions:</font></td></tr>

<p><font face="Times">All the Display PostScript operators and the NeXT extensions to the language can be accessed as C functions.&nbsp; In addition, NeXT supplies a program named <b>pswrap</b> that lets you generate C functions that correspond to your own PostScript procedures.</font>

<p><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Handling Events</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">Besides drawing images on the screen, the Window Server also identifies user events and dispatches them to your application.&nbsp; Through a mechanism defined in the Application Kit, the event is forwarded to the appropriate object:</font></td></tr>

<td><font face="Times">The event may be handled entirely by an Application Kit object.&nbsp; For example, if the user chooses a command that edits the text of a Text object, the operation is handled entirely by code that's built into the definition of the Text class in the Application Kit.</font></td></tr>

<td><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Sound Kit</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">A small number of system beep-type sound recordings, stored in files on the disk (called <i>soundfiles</i>), are provided by NeXT.&nbsp; Through Sound Kit, you can easily access these files and incorporate the sounds into your application.&nbsp; It's also extremely easy to record new sounds into the NeXT computer.&nbsp; Simply plug a microphone into the input jack at the back of the monitor and, with a single message to the Sound Kit's Sound object, you can record your own sound effect. Sound playback is just as simple:&nbsp; another message and the sound is played on the internal speaker and sent to the stereo output jacks at the back of the monitor.</font>

<p><font face="Times">When you record a sound using the Sound object, a series of audio &quot;snapshots&quot; or <i>samples</i> is created.&nbsp; By storing sound as samples, you can analyze and manipulate your sound data with an almost unlimited degree of precision.&nbsp; The SoundView class lets you see your sounds by displaying the samples in a window.</font>

<p><font face="Times">While Sound Kit is designed primarily for use on sampled data, you can also use it to send instructions to the DSP.&nbsp; The speed of the DSP makes it an ideal sound synthesizer and, in general, DSP instructions take up much less space than sampled data.&nbsp; The Sound object manages the details of playing sounds for you, so you needn't be aware of whether a particular Sound contains samples or DSP instructions.</font>

<p><br><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Music Kit</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">Music Kit provides a number of ways to compose and perform music.&nbsp; By attaching an external synthesizer keyboard to a serial port, you can play the NeXT computer as a musical instrument.&nbsp; Alternatively, you can compose music to be played by the computer by creating music data in a text editor or by creating an algorithm that generates it automatically.&nbsp; These approaches can be combined in performance.&nbsp; For instance, a musician can use an external keyboard to trigger precomposed events, allowing the computer to create sounds and gestures that are impossible on a traditional instrument, but at moments specified by the performer.</font>

<p><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Creating and Storing Music Data</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">Music Kit represents music as a series of Note objects.&nbsp; Each Note object describes the characteristics of a musical note, such as its pitch, loudness, and duration.&nbsp; How a Note object is performed depends on the detail it contains.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Notes can be stored in a file as statements written in <i>ScoreFile</i>, a music language developed at NeXT that represents music as text.&nbsp; A file written in the ScoreFile language is called a <i>scorefile</i>.&nbsp; In addition to reading and writing scorefiles from an application, you can also create and modify them with a text editor.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Music Kit recognizes the <i>MIDI</i> (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) standard.&nbsp; You can attach a MIDI instrument to a serial port at the back of the computer and capture a performance.&nbsp; MIDI commands are turned into Note objects that can be manipulated and stored.</font>

<p><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Creating and Performing Musical Sounds</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">As mentioned earlier, one of the benefits of the DSP56001 is that it can be used to synthesize sounds.&nbsp; The generality of the DSP allows a wide range of synthesis techniques; in fact, the DSP can emulate almost any commercially available keyboard synthesizer.&nbsp; A number of ready-to-use DSP software instruments are provided as Objective-C classes in the Music Kit.&nbsp; Software instruments are constructed from synthesis building blocks also written in Objective-C, so you can easily modify the existing instruments or design your own.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Just as you can enter music data through MIDI, you can perform music on an external synthesizer by sending MIDI data back out a serial port.&nbsp; Music Kit and music-related device drivers are designed to handle synchronization for you, allowing you to synthesize music on the DSP and send MIDI data to an external synthesizer at the same time.</font>

<p><font face="Times">By using objects from both Music Kit and Sound Kit, you can create an instrument that plays sampled data.&nbsp; For instance, you can use a Sound object to record a single tone from a traditional instrument and then play the tone back at the pitches and times specified by a series of Note objects.&nbsp; You can also use Sound Kit to record, in soundfiles, entire musical performances synthesized on the DSP.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Figure 1-5 shows the components for creating, playing, and storing music and sound with the hardware and software of the NeXT computer.</font></td></tr>
