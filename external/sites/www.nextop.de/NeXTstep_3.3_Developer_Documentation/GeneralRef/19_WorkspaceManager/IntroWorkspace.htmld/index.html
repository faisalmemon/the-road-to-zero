<td><font face="Times">The Workspace Manager lets the user navigate the file system and manipulate the files and directories therein.&nbsp; Workspace Manager's Inspector panel, with its four displays, gives additional information about a selected item, for example, file ownership and size (Attributes display), applications capable of opening the file (Tools display), and file permissions (Access display).&nbsp; Finally, the Inspector panel's Contents display can give the user information about the contents of certain types of files.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Since there is no limited to the number of file formats, it's impossible for the contents inspector to display the contents of all file types.&nbsp; NeXT provides inspectors for many of the most common formats--RTF, TIFF, EPS, to name a few--and provides a way for you to install a contents inspector for any other file format.&nbsp; It's even possible to replace a standard inspector with one of your own.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Contents inspectors are stored in bundle files that contain the code and interface objects that are loaded into the Workspace Manager.&nbsp; (For more information on bundles, see the class specification for NXBundle, a common class.)</font>

<p><font face="Times">When the Workspace Manager begins running, it locates contents inspector bundles by scanning the application search path (in this order):</font></td></tr>

<td><font face="Times">Finally, it searches in its own application file package, where it finds the standard modules.</font>

<p><font face="Times">For each directory that it searches, the Workspace Manager looks for bundles both within the directory and within application file packages (&quot;.app&quot; files) in the directory.&nbsp; When it finds a bundle, it checks the executable within it for registry information, information that the Workspace Manager uses to associate an inspector module with a specific file extension.&nbsp; (If more than one module registers for the same file extension, the module later in the search path is ignored.)&nbsp; When the user attempts to inspect the contents of a file, the Workspace Manager consults its registry of file extensions and inspectors and loads the appropriate inspector, if it hasn't been loaded already.</font>

<p><font face="Times">The Workspace Manager application and the contents inspector communicate through the API found in <b>/NextDeveloper/Headers/apps/Workspace.h</b>.&nbsp; This API consists of the declaration of the WMInspector class, an abstract superclass that defines the owner of the inspector module's interface.&nbsp; In creating your own contents inspector, you'll create a subclass of WMInspector and an interface that will appear in the Inspector panel.</font>

<p><font face="Times">The principal messages that the Workspace Manager sends your inspector object are <b>new</b> and <b>revert:</b>.&nbsp; It sends a <b>new</b> message whenever it needs to access the inspector object or, through the object, the interface to the inspector.&nbsp; It sends a <b>revert: </b>message whenever the inspector might need to be updated, such as when the selection in the File Viewer has changed.&nbsp; Thus, all inspector objects must implement these methods.</font>

<p><font face="Times">The inspector object, in turn, can query the Workspace Manager for information about the selection.&nbsp; The WMInspector class declares a method (<b>selectionCount</b>) for determining whether the selection contains a single item or multiple items, and another (<b>selectionPathsInto:separator:</b>) that returns the full path to each item in the selection.&nbsp; Your inspector object, therefore, can access this information by sending itself <b>selectionCount</b> and <b>selectionPathsInto:separator:</b> messages.</font>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>The Components of an Inspector Project</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">Contents inspectors are created as bundle projects; the process is outlined below.&nbsp; Before looking at the process, let's examine the components that are common to all inspector projects.&nbsp; As an illustration, we'll take the example of an inspector that shows the contents of files containing 3D graphics data in RIB format:&nbsp; &quot;.rib&quot; files.&nbsp; Even the simplest RIB inspector would have these components:</font></td></tr>

<p><font face="Times">Workspace Manager must be made aware of this new inspector.&nbsp; If you use Workspace Manager to copy the bundle into <b>~/Apps </b>(or anywhere in the application search path, for that matter), it will read the registry information the bundle contains.&nbsp; If you move the file by other means, use Workspace Manager's Update Viewers command to make it recheck for applications and inspectors in the application search path.&nbsp; After Workspace Manager has registered the new inspector, whenever a file of the proper extension (&quot;.rib&quot; in the example) is selected and the Contents inspector panel is visible, the custom contents inspector will be displayed.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Once an inspector has been loaded, it can't be unloaded without restarting the Workspace Manager (that is, logging out and back in again).&nbsp; For this and other reasons, it's often better to create a test application to debug a new inspector, as discussed in the next section.</font>

<p><br><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Debugging an Inspector</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">Your inspector operates within the main thread of execution of the Workspace Manager application, so errors occurring with the inspector can crash the Workspace Manager, bringing down with it all applications launched from the Workspace.&nbsp; Given the severity of the consequences, it's imperative that you ensure the reliability of your inspector's code.&nbsp; Unfortunately, at this time there's no standard way to debug inspectors; you'll have to devise your own test mechanisms.</font>

<p><font face="Times">The best strategy is to create a stand-alone debugging application, one that loads your inspector module into its own window just as the Workspace Manager does.&nbsp; You'll have to create a substitute WMInspector class since the main class in your module must inherit from WMInspector.&nbsp; You could perhaps use an OpenPanel as a means of selecting specific files for your module to inspect.</font>

<p><font face="Times">A debugging application makes it easier, safer, and faster to debug your inspector; however, at times you may find it necessary to debug the inspector after it's been loaded into the Workspace Manager.&nbsp; To do this, you'll need to prevent the inspector's symbol table from being stripped.</font>

<p><font face="Times">By default, when the Workspace Manager loads an inspector bundle, it strips the executable code of its symbols.&nbsp; To prevent this, in a shell window enter:</font></td></tr>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Working Within the Workspace Manager</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">Some contents inspectors display the actual contents of a file while others show only a synopsis.&nbsp; For example, the contents inspector for TIFF and RTF files shows the complete contents, but the Sound inspector shows only summary information.&nbsp; The Sound inspector, however, does offer the user a button that, when clicked, plays the sound.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Since contents inspectors operate in the Workspace Manager's main thread, it's best to let the user decide whether the panel should embark on time- or resource-intensive operations, as illustrated by the Sound inspector panel.&nbsp; (The RIB inspector example outlined above would no doubt include a Render button.)</font></td></tr>
