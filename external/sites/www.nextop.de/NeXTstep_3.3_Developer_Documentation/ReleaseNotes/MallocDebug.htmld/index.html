<p><font face="Times">To record which nodes are touched, MallocDebug must place each allocated node from the relevant zones on its own virtual memory page.&nbsp; Because of this additional memory requirement, you have control over which zones have this per-node monitoring enabled.&nbsp; After you link your application with <b>libMallocDebug.a</b>, you must run the <b>mdbsetup</b> program on your application to enable per-node monitoring for various zones.&nbsp; The command</font></td></tr>

<td><font face="Times">The debugging version of <b>malloc</b> used by <b>MallocDebug</b> is implemented differently from the standard system <b>malloc</b> so that its internal data structures are much less susceptible to being damaged by aberrant programs.&nbsp; This causes several incompatibilities with the standard <b>malloc</b>:</font>

<p><font face="Times"><img src="../Images/bullet1.gif" width=4 height=8 vspace=3> The debugging <b>malloc</b> implements zones by tagging each node with a zone tag rather than actually allocating the node in a different region of memory. Consequently, locality of reference of a program which uses zones cannot be determined by examining the addresses of nodes in <b>MallocDebug</b>.</font>

<p><font face="Times"><img src="../Images/bullet1.gif" width=4 height=8 vspace=3> The debugging <b>malloc</b> does not store information about nodes in the nodes themselves, but rather in an auxiliary data structure which is kept in a remote area of memory.&nbsp; This data is accessed by hashing the address of the node, but this information <i>cannot</i> be accessed from an address which is within the node.&nbsp; For this reason, the <b>NXZoneFromPtr</b> function will work correctly only when passed a pointer to the start of a node.&nbsp; Otherwise it will return <b>NX_NOZONE</b>.&nbsp; For the same reason the leak detector may report a node as a leak even if there is a pointer to some internal part of that node.</font></td></tr>
