<td><font face="Times">A NEXTSTEP keyboard resembles a conventional typewriter, with the usual keys in their traditional locations.&nbsp; However, the keyboard also has many keys that aren't found on typewriters, including the Command, Alternate, Control, and Help keys and a set of keys arranged in a calculator-style numeric keypad.&nbsp; The behavior of each key is documented in the <i>User's Guide</i>. Behavior that plays an important role in the user interface is discussed below.</font>

<p><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Modifier Keys</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">The keyboard's Shift, Command, Alternate, Control, and Help keys are <i>modifier keys</i>:&nbsp; They change the effect of a keyboard or mouse action.&nbsp; For example, Shift-3 yields #, and Command-c issues a Copy command.&nbsp; Unlike character keys, modifier keys by themselves don't generate characters.</font>

<p><font face="Times">To use a modifier key, the user must hold the key down and, while keeping it down, press the key (or perform the mouse action) to be modified.&nbsp; More than one modifier key may be used at a time--for example, Command-Shift-C.</font>

<p><font face="Times">The modifier keys and their effects when used with other keys are presented below.</font></td></tr>

<td><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Clicking</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">The user <i>clicks</i> an object by positioning the cursor over it, then pressing and releasing a mouse button.&nbsp; Usually the mouse isn't moved during a click, and the mouse button is quickly released after it's pressed.&nbsp; However, timing generally isn't important. What's important is what object the cursor is over when the mouse button is pressed and released.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Clicking is used to pick an object or a location on the screen.&nbsp; If the object is a window, the click brings it to the front and may select it to receive characters from the keyboard.&nbsp; If the object is a menu command, button, or other control, the click performs the control's action.&nbsp; In text, a click selects the <i>insertion point</i> (the place where the user's typing will be entered).&nbsp; In a graphics editor, it may select the location for a Paste command.</font>

<p><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Multiple-Clicking</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">The user <i>double-clicks</i> an object by positioning the cursor over it, then quickly pressing and releasing a mouse button twice in succession.&nbsp; The mouse button must be pressed the second time within a short interval of the first, or the action will count as two successive clicks rather than a double-click.&nbsp; In addition, the cursor can't move significantly during the interval.&nbsp; This is to guarantee that the double-click remains focused on a single location on-screen.</font>

<p><font face="Times">With the Preferences application, users can set the maximum length of the time interval between clicks to suit their individual needs.</font>

<p><font face="Times">The user <i>triple-clicks</i> an object by rapidly pressing and releasing a mouse button three times in succession.&nbsp; The time interval between successive clicks and the distance the cursor can move between the first and the last click are subject to the same constraints that apply to a double-click.</font></td></tr>

<p><font face="Times">In general, every dragging action implies a click.&nbsp; Dragging a window, for example, also brings it to the front, as if it had been clicked.&nbsp; However, sometimes it's appropriate to separate an object's response to dragging from its response to clicking.&nbsp; See &quot;When Dragging Shouldn't Imply Clicking,&quot; later in this chapter, for information on when dragging should not imply a click.</font>

<p><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Pressing</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">The user <i>presses</i> an object on-screen by positioning the cursor over it, pressing a mouse button, and holding the button down for a period of time.&nbsp; Although pressing implies clicking (since the mouse button must be released sometime), an object is said to be pressed rather than clicked if releasing the mouse button too soon would cut the action short.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Control objects that respond to pressing act immediately when the mouse button is pressed.&nbsp; They don't wait for the button to go up.</font>

<p><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Mouse Responsiveness</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">The cursor moves on-screen when the user moves the mouse, but the ratio of the two movements isn't one-to-one.&nbsp; Rapid mouse movements move the cursor farther than slow ones.&nbsp; Users can set the <i>mouse scaling</i>, how responsive the cursor is to mouse movements at different speeds, with the Preferences application.</font>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Left and Right Orientation</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">To start, the two buttons of the mouse work identically:&nbsp; Either button can be used for the ordinary operations of clicking, dragging, and pressing.</font>

<p><font face="Times">The two buttons can be differentiated with the Preferences application.&nbsp; Users can enable one of the buttons, either the right or the left, for the special function of bringing the main menu to the cursor.&nbsp; (See &quot;Bringing the Main Menu to the Cursor&quot; in Chapter 6, &quot;Menus,&quot; for details.)&nbsp; Thereafter, the enabled button has only that function, and it can't be used for ordinary mouse operations.&nbsp; This leaves the other button as the one that will be primarily used.</font>

<p><font face="Times">If the anchor point and end point are substantially the same--as they are for a click--the user's action may sometimes select the item under the cursor and sometimes simply select that location.&nbsp; In a graphics editor, for example, a click can select an existing figure or a location to insert a new one.</font>

<p><font face="Times">In text, a click always selects a location--an insertion point--where characters can be entered from the keyboard.&nbsp; The insertion point is normally marked by a blinking vertical bar located between characters.&nbsp; If the user clicks on top of a character, the insertion point is adjusted to the nearest character boundary.&nbsp; Clicking in a margin, or in an empty area away from any text, puts the insertion point next to the nearest character in series.</font>

<p><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Multiple-Clicking to Select</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">Although a single click selects only an insertion point in text, multiple-clicking selects characters already inserted.&nbsp; A multiple-click always selects a linguistically meaningful unit.&nbsp; Normally, double-clicking selects a word, and triple-clicking selects a paragraph (all the text between return characters).</font>

<p><font face="Times">If the user drags from a multiple-click, additional units of the same type are selected.&nbsp; For example, double-clicking a word selects the word; dragging from the double-click then selects every other word that's even partially within the range defined by the anchor and end points.</font>

<p><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Extending the Selection</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">Normally, as soon as users commit themselves to a new selection by pressing a mouse button (to begin clicking or dragging), the current selection is canceled in favor of the new one.&nbsp; However, when the Alternate or Shift key is held down, the current selection is extended, not canceled.</font>

<p><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica"><b>Continuous Extension</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">Clicking and dragging with the Alternate key down results in a new selection that's a continuation of the previous one.&nbsp; The new selection includes the previous selection and everything lying between it and the location of the cursor when the user releases the mouse button.&nbsp; The Alternate key is thus an alternative to dragging as a way of selecting a range--the user can click to establish an anchor point, hold down the Alternate key, and click again to determine the end point.</font>

<p><font face="Times">If the previous selection is already a range, Alternate-clicking and Alternate-dragging move the edge of selection that's closest to the cursor when the mouse button goes down to the cursor's location when the mouse button goes up.&nbsp; The Alternate key thus also provides a way of adjusting the boundaries of the previous selection.&nbsp; Alternate-clicking outside a selected range extends the range to the point of the click.&nbsp; Alternate-clicking inside a selected range repositions the closest edge of the selection to the point of the click.</font></td></tr>

<p><font face="Times">In text, the keyboard's arrow keys are used to position the insertion point or, when modified by the Alternate key, alter the selection.&nbsp; But unlike the mouse, which can select anywhere within a document, the arrow keys operate only relative to the current selection.&nbsp; The descriptions below assume that the current selection, before the user touches an arrow key, is a range of text.&nbsp; The simpler case where the current selection is not a range but an insertion point is not directly addressed, but can easily be derived from the descriptions given.</font>

<p><font face="Helvetica"><b>Note:</b></font>&nbsp; <font face="Times">The arrow keys have nothing to do with the cursor, which is controlled only by the user's mouse movements.</font>

<p><font face="Times">When used alone (without a modifier key), the left arrow key positions the insertion point one character before the beginning of the current selection.&nbsp; The right arrow key puts the insertion point one character beyond the end of the current selection.&nbsp; These keys move the insertion point to the previous or next line if necessary.</font>

<p><font face="Times">The up arrow key puts the insertion point one line above the beginning of the current selection, and the down arrow key puts it one line below the end of the current selection.&nbsp; As the up and down arrow keys move it from line to line, the insertion point maintains the same approximate distance from the left margin.&nbsp; It falls at the end of any line that's shorter than that distance, but comes back out to the original distance when a line that's long enough is encountered.</font>

<p><font face="Times">More information on handling the arrow keys is in &quot;Implementing Special Keys&quot; in this chapter.&nbsp; Modified arrow keys--for example, Alternate-arrow--are discussed in &quot;Implementing the Modified Arrow Keys,&quot; later in this chapter.</font></td></tr>

<td><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Creating Application-Specific Keyboard Alternatives</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">The NEXTSTEP user interface is visual, so all operations--all menu commands and scrolling operations, for example--have a graphical representation on-screen and can be performed using the mouse.&nbsp; Keyboard alternatives are just that:&nbsp; alternatives. They should never be used for operations that can't be performed using the mouse.</font>

<p><font face="Times">The main consideration in deciding which operations should have keyboard alternatives is frequency of use.&nbsp; It's better to assign a keyboard alternative to a frequently used command than to one that's used less often.&nbsp; Infrequently used commands--such as the Info Panel command--should never be assigned keyboard alternatives.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Keyboard alternatives are allowed only for the commands in a menu, the buttons in a panel, or the items in a pull-down list.&nbsp; The characters used as keyboard alternatives must be displayed to the user in the menu, panel, or list.&nbsp; Menus put them on the commands themselves, and pull-down lists follow this example.&nbsp; A panel can present the keyboard alternatives for its buttons in any way that's appropriate to the design of the panel.</font>

<p><font face="Times">It's usually a good idea to assign keyboard alternatives to commands that are needed while working on the keyboard (for example, the commands in the Find menu).&nbsp; The keyboard alternative frees users from having to switch their attention from the keyboard to the mouse and back again.</font>

<p><font face="Times">You can also use keyboard alternatives to enable proficient users to work with one hand on the keyboard and the other on the mouse.&nbsp; For example, Command-x, Command-c, and Command-v allow users to select with the mouse while carrying out cut, copy, and paste operations from the keyboard.&nbsp; These keyboard alternatives free users from having to move the cursor out of the region where they're working just to click a command.</font>

<p><font face="Times">If keyboard alternatives are assigned to any in a set of parallel commands for formatting or viewing data (for example, commands that sort a list of items in various ways), the command that restores the default should also be assigned a keyboard alternative.&nbsp; The keyboard can then take the user to an alternative format and back to the default, rather than just half way.</font>

<p><font face="Helvetica"><b>Note:</b></font>&nbsp; <font face="Times">You don't need to assign a keyboard alternative to every command.&nbsp; Remember that users can create their own global keyboard alternatives by using the Preferences application.</font>

<p><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica"><b>Choosing the Character</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">Any character except period (.) and space can be used in a keyboard alternative.&nbsp; If the character is a letter, it can be either uppercase or lowercase, although lowercase characters are preferred because they don't require the user to press two modifier keys (Shift and Command) at once.</font>

<p><font face="Times">When choosing the character for a keyboard alternative, try to make it mnemonic.&nbsp; If possible, it should be the first letter of the command it performs.&nbsp; If it's closely related to a command that already has a keyboard alternative, then you might want to choose a character physically near the existing one.</font>

<p><font face="Times">For example, the Find command's keyboard alternative is Command-f, taken from the first letter of the command.&nbsp; The Find command has two related commands:&nbsp; Find Next and Find Previous.&nbsp; The Find Next command's keyboard alternative (Command-g) was chosen because it's just to the right of the Find command's keyboard alternative.&nbsp; Similarly, the Find Previous command's keyboard alternative (Command-d) is just to the left.</font>

<p><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica"><b>Using the Alternate Key</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">If necessary, your application can use the Alternate key with the Command key for keyboard alternatives.&nbsp; Using the Alternate key is not desirable.&nbsp; You should first exhaust all reasonable possibilities using the Command key alone or in combination with the Shift key before resorting to the Alternate key.</font>

<p><font face="Times">But, when necessary, a keyboard alternative requiring the Alternate key can be used.&nbsp; It should be displayed in italic.</font></td></tr>

<p><font face="Helvetica"><b>Determining the Action that Is Performed</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">A keyboard alternative should almost always accomplish exactly the same thing as the mouse action.&nbsp; Even slight variations between a mouse action and its keyboard alternative run counter to the principle that every keyboard operation must match a corresponding mouse operation.&nbsp; However, in some cases it's acceptable to have a keyboard alternative do just a bit more than the mouse operation.&nbsp; These cases are rare and often go unnoticed by users because the difference is both subtle and intuitive. The keyboard alternative simply does what the user wants, while also doing one or both of the following:</font></td></tr>

<td><font face="Times">For example, the Edit application has a Find panel that's brought up by the Find Panel menu command or its Command-f keyboard alternative.&nbsp; Usually, the panel stays up until the user explicitly closes it, since it can be used many times in a row. However, a user who is concentrating on entering text often wants to find a word in a document but then doesn't want to use the Find panel for a while.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Edit accounts for both kinds of use by automatically closing the panel if the user is not likely to use the Find panel immediately. It assumes that this is the case if the user doesn't use the mouse to conduct the search (instead, using Command-f to bring up the panel, and starting the search by pressing Return).&nbsp; Edit's behavior lets users find a word using a minimum number of actions, and relieves them of having to switch to the mouse to bring the document window back in front of the Find panel.</font>

<p><font face="Times">In general, you should start with all keyboard alternatives the same as their associated mouse action.&nbsp; In the rare case when a keyboard alternative should be different from its associated mouse action, the need becomes clear through everyday use.</font></td></tr>

<p><font face="Times">The first solution listed above (requiring a modifier key when dragging) isn't appropriate in this case.&nbsp; Moving an icon is a basic, obvious operation, and unmodified dragging is the natural way to accomplish it.</font>

<p><font face="Times">The second solution (having dragging not perform a click) also doesn't work, mainly because the action (activating an application) has consequences that the user might want to avoid (such as creating windows that cover the user's work) and that can't be reversed until the application is fully started up.&nbsp; Also, having a single click perform the action doesn't match the behavior of application icons in the File Viewer.&nbsp; In the File Viewer, a single click merely selects the application's file.&nbsp; It isn't started up until the user double-clicks it.</font>

<p><font face="Times">So the only acceptable solution for docked application icons is for double-clicking to start up the application, while single-clicking does nothing.</font>

<p><font face="Times">An example of where dragging doesn't imply a single click is in the File Viewer shelf.&nbsp; When the user clicks the icon of a folder on the shelf, the File Viewer changes to show the folder's path.&nbsp; However, when the user drags the icon off the shelf, the File Viewer does <i>not</i> perform the click's action--it doesn't change the current path.&nbsp; One of the reasons this solution works is that the shelf differentiates clicking from dragging by having a threshold for dragging.&nbsp; Until the user drags the icon a certain amount, it doesn't move.&nbsp; Once the user has committed to dragging the icon, it can't be clicked.&nbsp; The icon also looks very different when it's clicked (it's highlighted) from when it's dragged (it moves, and a dimmed copy is visible in its old location).</font>

<p><font face="Times">The Application Kit contains support for moving objects between and within applications.&nbsp; It even changes the cursor to indicate whether the object is being moved, copied, or linked.&nbsp; See &quot;Managing the Cursor,&quot; later in this chapter, for more information on changing the cursor.</font>

<p><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Defining a Range</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">The user can also drag over an area or through a series of items (such as text characters) to define a range.&nbsp; The position of the cursor when the mouse button is pressed is the <i>anchor point</i>.&nbsp; Its position when the mouse button is released is the <i>end point</i>. The difference between the anchor point and end point determines the area or objects inside the range.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Dragging to define a range is mostly used to make a selection (such as a string of text characters or a group of icons) for the targeted-action paradigm.</font>

<p><font face="Times">When the user drags to define a rectangular range (as in a drawing program), applications often drag out--or &quot;rubberband&quot;--a rectangle to show the area covered between the anchor point and end point.&nbsp; See &quot;The Range that Dragging Should Select,&quot; later in this chapter, for more information on dragging to define a rectangular range.</font></td></tr>

<p><font face="Times">For example, a user can choose a menu command by pressing the mouse button as the cursor points to one command and releasing it as it points to another.&nbsp; Users can similarly drag from one tool to another tool when they're displayed together in a palette, or from button to button in a set of radio buttons.</font>

<p><font face="Times">The grouped objects don't all have to be of the same type.&nbsp; For example, a user can drag from a button that controls a pop-up list through the list to make a selection, or from a menu command that controls a submenu into the submenu.</font>

<p><font face="Times">If the user can drag from one object to another in a group of objects, then this fact should be apparent from the way the objects are displayed.&nbsp; Usually, such objects are displayed in a single row or column, as close to each other as possible.&nbsp; For example, graphical radio buttons should be right up next to each other, to distinguish them from ordinary buttons.&nbsp; (Graphical radio buttons are discussed in detail in Chapter 7, &quot;Controls.&quot;)</font>

<p><br><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>When to Use Pressing</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">For the most part, pressing is an alternative to repeated clicking.&nbsp; It should be used wherever a control action can be repeated with incremental effect.&nbsp; For example, clicking a scroll button scrolls one line of text, clicking the button again scrolls another line, and so on.&nbsp; Pressing the scroll button scrolls lines repeatedly for a continuous action until the mouse button is released.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Pressing is also used to initiate the action of sliding from one object to another.&nbsp; If a button controls a pop-up list, the user presses the button and drags through the list to choose one of its options.&nbsp; After pressing a menu command to bring up a submenu, the user can drag into the submenu.</font>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Changing the Cursor</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">An application can change the cursor from the standard arrow (shown above) to any other image of an equal size (16 pixels by 16 pixels).&nbsp; When doing so, it must specify what point in the cursor acts like the tip of the arrow.&nbsp; That point, the cursor's <i>hot spot</i>, should be apparent to the user from the shape of the image.&nbsp; For example, if the cursor is an X, the hot spot would be where the two lines cross.</font>

<p><font face="Times">For some types of applications, a shape other than an arrow might be more convenient.&nbsp; For example, an I-beam cursor (shown above) is handier for positioning between characters.&nbsp; Its hot spot is in the center of the beam.</font>

<p><font face="Times">It's often a good idea to change the shape of the cursor to indicate that the user has entered a mode.&nbsp; In applications that use the modal-tool paradigm, the cursor should change to indicate which tool has been selected.&nbsp; For example, the cursor might look like a pencil while thin lines are being drawn in a graphics application, or like a wide brush when painting in broad strokes.</font>

<p><font face="Times">If mouse actions are valid only in a certain area, the cursor should revert to its normal shape when it leaves the area.&nbsp; It's best not to change the cursor too often, however.&nbsp; To avoid confusing the user, stick with the standard arrow wherever reasonable.</font>

<p><br><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Hiding the Cursor</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">A visible cursor is essential for mouse actions, but it can get in the way when the user is concentrating on using the keyboard. Therefore, the Text object automatically hides the cursor--making it disappear from the screen--when the user begins entering text.&nbsp; A hidden cursor returns to the screen as soon as the user moves the mouse, signaling a shift in attention away from the keyboard back to the mouse.</font>

<p><font face="Times">The cursor should also be hidden whenever the user selects an insertion point or a range of text.&nbsp; (This is not currently implemented by the Text object, so each application should do this for itself.)&nbsp; A new selection is a good indication that the user is ready to begin typing again.&nbsp; Hiding the cursor when the user selects a new insertion point avoids confusion between the I-beam cursor and the vertical bar representing the insertion point.&nbsp; Unless it's hidden, the I-beam can obscure the vertical bar. Again, the cursor reappears as soon as the user moves the mouse.</font></td></tr>

<p><font face="Times">The up arrow key positions the insertion point in the first visible line of the display, directly above the beginning of the current selection.&nbsp; The down arrow key puts the insertion point in the last visible line, directly below the end of the current selection.</font>

<p><font face="Times">When the insertion point is already at the edge of the currently visible display, the Control-arrow combination that would otherwise move it to that edge first scrolls the display (by the amount of a page scroll), then moves the insertion point to the edge of the new display.&nbsp; Once the insertion point reaches the beginning of a line, the right arrow key won't move it further (for example, to another line).&nbsp; The left arrow key won't move it once it reaches the end of a line.</font>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Shift-Arrow Combinations</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">Modified by the Shift key, the left arrow key positions the insertion point to the left of the current selection at the beginning of a word.&nbsp; The right arrow key positions it to the right of the current selection at the end of a word.&nbsp; Thus both keys move the insertion point from word to word.</font>

<p><font face="Times">The up arrow key puts the insertion point at the beginning of the word one line directly above the beginning of the current selection.&nbsp; The down arrow key puts it at the end of the word one line directly below the end of the current selection.&nbsp; As the up and down arrow keys move the insertion point from line to line, they choose words that lie directly above or below the original starting point.&nbsp; (In other words, the location of the insertion point can be calculated by the same rules that determine the edge of the selection when the user double-clicks and drags directly upward or directly downward.)</font>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Alternate-Arrow Combinations</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">Modified by the Alternate key, the arrow keys extend the current selection by one character or one line at a time.&nbsp; Users choose which edge of the selection to modify by the arrow key they press first.</font>

<p><font face="Times">When pressed first, the left arrow key moves the beginning of the current selection one character to the left (toward the beginning of the document).&nbsp; Subsequently, the left and right arrow keys both act on this same edge of the selection, moving it one character to the left or right.&nbsp; When pressed first, the right arrow key moves the end of the current selection one character to the right (toward the end of the document).&nbsp; Subsequently, the left and right arrow keys both act on the end of the selection.</font>

<p><font face="Times">When pressed first, the up arrow key moves the beginning of the current selection up one line.&nbsp; Subsequently, the up and down arrow keys both move this same edge of the selection up and down a line.&nbsp; When pressed first, the down arrow key moves the end of the current selection down one line.&nbsp; Subsequently, the up and down arrow keys both move the end of the selection.</font>

<p><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Other Arrow Key Combinations</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">More than one modifier key can be used in combination with an arrow key, with additive results.&nbsp; Thus, Shift-Alternate-right arrow extends the selection to the end of a word, and Control-Shift-up arrow places the insertion point at the beginning of a word in the first visible line of the display.&nbsp; However, Alternate and Control can't be used together because that combination is reserved by the system as a substitute for the Help key.</font></td></tr>
