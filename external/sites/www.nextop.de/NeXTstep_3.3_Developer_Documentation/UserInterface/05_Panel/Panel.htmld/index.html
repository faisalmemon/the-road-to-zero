<td><font face="Times">Panels support the work done in the principal windows of an application.&nbsp; Like menus, most panels are vehicles through which the user can give instructions to the application.&nbsp; But unlike menus, they aren't restricted to a single column of commands:&nbsp; A panel can provide the user with a variety of different control objects--buttons, sliders, text fields, and more--arranged as best suits its purpose.&nbsp; The Font, Find, Page Layout, and Open panels are all examples.&nbsp; Such panels can be viewed as generalized and more versatile menus.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Some panels play a different role, however.&nbsp; Instead of letting the user give instructions to the application, they give information to the user.&nbsp; Help panels, the Info panel, and attention panels that display warnings are examples.</font>

<p><font face="Times">What unites all panels--whether they convey instructions from the user to the application or information from the application to the user--is that they play conventional, supporting roles.&nbsp; Unlike windows, none of them is a site for the user's main work in the application.&nbsp; In a panel, the dialog between the application and the user is highly structured in both form and content.</font>

(Similarly, custom ordinary panels should look like ordinary panels, and not like attention panels.)</font></td></tr>

<p><font face="Times">An attention panel demands attention from users by denying them the ability to work in any other window of the active application.&nbsp; Until it's explicitly dismissed, the panel limits what the user can do within the application to just rearranging windows.&nbsp; Nothing else--title bar buttons, text entry, miniwindows, or controls in other panels--will work.&nbsp; The only menu commands that work are those that can affect the panel itself--for example, Cut, Copy, and Paste, if the panel includes a text field.</font>

<p><font face="Times">It's possible to activate another application while an attention panel is on-screen, but when the user returns to the previous application, the mode created by the attention panel is still in effect.</font>

<td><font face="Times">Ordinary panels can be used in many ways, so you have many choices when implementing them.&nbsp; This chapter discusses the conventions for ordinary panels that are different from those for standard windows.</font>

<p><br><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Window Considerations</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">Although ordinary panels are similar to standard windows, conventions for title bar buttons and key-window status differ slightly from those for standard windows.&nbsp; For more detailed information on the title bar buttons and on key windows, see &quot;Implementing Windows&quot; in Chapter 4.</font>

<p><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Using the Resize Bar</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">If resizing the panel might be useful, then it should have a resize bar.&nbsp; Like a standard window, a panel should constrain its shape if necessary to prevent the panel from becoming a size that's too large or too small.</font>

<p><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Using the Miniaturize Button</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">A panel can have a miniaturize button, but it's rare that one would be needed.&nbsp; Like menus, panels can be closed and returned to the screen through a menu command.&nbsp; A miniaturize button is redundant unless a miniwindow would, for some reason, be more convenient for the user than the command, or unless the panel persists on-screen when the application isn't active (see &quot;Persisting Panels,&quot; later in this chapter).</font>

<p><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Using the Close Button</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">Every ordinary panel should have a close button so the user can dismiss the panel when it's not needed.&nbsp; The close button is never broken, since panels don't contain the main work of the application.</font>

<p><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Becoming the Key Window</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">An ordinary panel should become the key window only if it accepts keystrokes (typing) or if it's used independently of any other windows.&nbsp; For example, the Find panel becomes the key window so that the user can type in the word to be found.&nbsp; But the tools palette in a graphics application should never become the key window because it's operated only by the mouse and it's always used in conjunction with a document window.&nbsp; On the other hand, the standard Info panel should become the key window because it contains information that's independent of the application's other windows.&nbsp; In other words, it's the center of the user's attention and thus should be the key window.</font>

<p><font face="Times">A panel that accepts keystrokes can delay becoming the key window until the user indicates a readiness to begin typing (such as by clicking in a text field), provided that both of the following are true:</font></td></tr>

</table>

<p>

<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0>

<tr valign=top>

<td width=106></td>

<td><font face="Times">This is likely to be the case if most of the control devices in the panel are not text fields (they are buttons, selection lists, and so on) and if the choices that can be made by entering text can also be made in an alternative way (for example, by selecting items from a list).&nbsp; The Font panel is an example.&nbsp; This kind of panel should not show any selection until the user indicates a readiness to begin typing.</font></td></tr>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="-1">Panels that need to avoid becoming the key window until the user indicates a readiness to begin typing can use the <b>setBecomeKeyOnlyIfNeeded:</b> method of the Panel class to do so.</font>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="-1">However, panels&nbsp; that should never become key--a tools palette, for example--must use a different way to avoid becoming the key window.&nbsp; Each panel must remove key-down and key-up events from its event mask.</font></td></tr>

<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0>

<tr valign=top>

<td width=106></td>

<td><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Relinquishing Key-Window Status</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">A panel should remain the key window only as long as necessary.&nbsp; If user actions within the panel affect the main window, key-window status should be returned to the main window as soon as those actions are completed.</font>

<p><font face="Times">For example, when the user clicks the Set button (or types Return) in a Font panel to change the font of the current selection in the main window, the panel gives up key-window status (if it had it).&nbsp; In all likelihood, the user is finished with the Font panel (at least until the selection has changed) and is ready to resume working in the main window.&nbsp; Under these circumstances, the user should be free to begin working in the main window immediately, without being forced to click in it just to make it the key window.</font>

<p><br><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Exceptions to Ordinary Panel Behavior</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">In general, ordinary panels are unobtrusive.&nbsp; They're in the lowest tier on-screen, and they disappear when their application is deactivated.&nbsp; Sometimes, though, an ordinary panel needs to be more prominent, as described in the following sections.</font>

<p><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Persisting Panels</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">By default, an ordinary panel is removed from the screen when its application is deactivated.&nbsp; The user sees only panels related to the active application.&nbsp; This prevents confusion--such as might arise when similar Find panels for two different applications are on-screen at once.</font>

<p><font face="Times">An application can override this default behavior and allow a panel to remain on-screen after the application has been deactivated, but only if the panel contains information that would be pertinent to the user's activities in another application.&nbsp; This should be a rare occurrence.</font>

<p><font face="Times">An example is the Workspace Manager Info panel, which contains system-level information such as the amount of memory in the computer.&nbsp; Because the user might want to copy this information down--for example, into a mail message--this panel persists even when the Workspace Manager is deactivated.</font>

<p><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Floating Panels</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">Ordinary panels are normally in the same tier as standard windows.&nbsp; Sometimes, though, it's useful to have a panel float above all other standard windows and ordinary panels.&nbsp; For example, a small panel containing a palette of drawing tools is most useful if it floats above the application's other windows.&nbsp; An example of a palette is below.</font></td></tr>

<p><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Multiform Panels</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">A multiform panel is a panel that has a pop-up list or set of graphical radio buttons at the top that lets the user choose which form the panel takes.&nbsp; For example, the following panel lets the user choose any one of seven different forms.</font></td></tr>

<p><font face="Times">An inspector panel is any panel that displays information about the object that's currently selected.&nbsp; Inspectors usually let the user set properties of the object, as well.&nbsp; The Font panel (described in &quot;Standard Panels&quot; later in this chapter) is an inspector panel.&nbsp; It displays information about the font of the current selection.&nbsp; The Workspace Manager Inspector panel (shown below) lets the user see and set information about the currently selected file or folder.&nbsp; Inspectors are often multiform panels, with each form displaying a different kind of information about an object.</font></td></tr>

<p><font face="Times">When a user action brings up an attention panel with a variety of choices, the default button, the one in the lower right corner of the panel, should allow the user to easily carry through with the action.&nbsp; It should not contradict what the user set out to do. Specifically, it should not be the Cancel button.</font>

<p><font face="Times">The default button should not perform any additional action not implied by the user request that brought up the panel.&nbsp; In general, it should be the safest of the alternatives (for example, Open Copy rather than Open Anyway when the user tries to open a document that someone's already opened).</font>

<p><font face="Times">The default button in an attention panel should normally be operable by pressing the Return key on the keyboard (when the panel is the key window).&nbsp; If so, it should be marked by the Return symbol <img src="EPS1.gif" width=16 height=11>.&nbsp; However, if the button has dangerous side effects, it's acceptable to require that the user press the button.</font>

<p><br><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Dismissing an Attention Panel</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">Each action that can dismiss an attention panel is represented by a separate button inside its content area.&nbsp; In contrast, an ordinary panel is closed only by its close button (or the Close Window command), never by a button in the content area.</font>

<p><font face="Times">The buttons that dismiss an attention panel should be located along the right and lower edges of the panel, with the default button in the lower right corner.&nbsp; No button except for the default button should be operable by the Return key.</font>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Naming Buttons in an Attention Panel</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">When the user tries to quit an application that has unsaved or uncompleted work, the application should bring up a Quit panel. For example, if the user has edited a document and not saved the changes, or if the application is still computing (for example, a command is executing in a UNIX shell), a Quit panel should appear.&nbsp; In both cases, one or more of the application's windows should have a broken close button, as described in &quot;Using the Close Button&quot; in Chapter 4.</font>
