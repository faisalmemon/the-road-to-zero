<td><font face="Times">The main purpose of menus is to provide commands for the user to choose.&nbsp; To choose a menu command, the user presses the mouse button as the cursor points anywhere within the content area of the menu and releases it as the cursor points to the desired command.&nbsp; This can be as simple as clicking the command, or the user can drag through the menu, from command to command.&nbsp; Each command that comes under the cursor while the mouse button is down is highlighted.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Instead of using the mouse, the user can often use a keyboard alternative to choose a command.&nbsp; A keyboard alternative is a combination of a character and the Command key.&nbsp; For example, holding down the Command key and pressing the <b>p</b> key is the standard keyboard alternative for the Print command.&nbsp; Keyboard alternatives are discussed in detail in Chapter 3, &quot;User Actions: The Keyboard and Mouse.&quot;</font>

<p><br><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>The Main Menu</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">Every NEXTSTEP application has at least one menu, its main menu.&nbsp; If an application has just a main menu, it holds all the commands for the application.&nbsp; If the application has more than one menu, all but the main menu are submenus of another menu. Through the hierarchical arrangement of submenus, the main menu gives the user access to all the menus of the application.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Because the main menu is at the top of the menu hierarchy, it lacks a close button and always remains on-screen when its application is active.</font>

<p><font face="Times">By default, when an application first starts up, its main menu appears in the upper left corner of the screen.&nbsp; Users can change this default location by dragging the main menu to a new position.&nbsp; Another way to change the default location for all applications (except those whose main menus have already been moved) is with the Preferences application.</font>

<p><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Bringing the Main Menu to the Cursor</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">If the user enables one of the mouse buttons (with the Preferences application), it can be used to gain quick access to the main menu.&nbsp; When the user presses the enabled mouse button (except when the cursor is over an application icon), a copy of the main menu for the active application appears under the cursor.&nbsp; The copy stays on-screen until the mouse button is released.</font></td></tr>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Submenus</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">The main menu is the only menu in an application that isn't a submenu.&nbsp; Every other menu is a submenu of another menu, which is its <i>supermenu</i> in the application's hierarchy of menus.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Each submenu is associated with a particular command in its supermenu.&nbsp; The submenu becomes visible and <i>attaches</i> to its supermenu when the user chooses the command that it's associated with.</font>

<p><font face="Times">The user can drag from a controlling command into a submenu to choose one of the submenu's commands.&nbsp; As long as the mouse button is held down, the submenu remains visible and the controlling command stays highlighted.&nbsp; But once the mouse button goes up and the command has been executed, the submenu disappears.</font></td></tr>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Commands</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">A menu can display several different kinds of commands, all of which use the targeted-action paradigm.&nbsp; Some commands require the user to select the target--Copy, Paste, and Miniaturize Window, for example.&nbsp; Others--such as Hide, Quit, and Info--don't require a selection:&nbsp; The target is built into the program.</font>

<p><font face="Times">When a command is chosen--whether it's clicked or activated by a keyboard alternative--it's highlighted.&nbsp; Keyboard alternatives can also operate commands in off-screen menus.&nbsp; When they do, the menu's controlling command (or, if the supermenu isn't visible, the supermenu's controlling command) is highlighted.&nbsp; This ensures users of immediate, visual feedback that the keyboard alternative has in fact invoked the command.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Some commands control submenus.&nbsp; The action of the command is simply to attach the submenu to the menu.&nbsp; These commands are marked by the submenu symbol <img src="../../Images/EPS18.gif" width=8 height=9 vspace=3>.</font>

<p><br><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Designing the Menu Hierarchy</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">When designing your application's menu hierarchy, you should start with the standard menus described later in this chapter--in particular, the main menu.&nbsp; Having standard menus, as much as possible, is one of the easiest and best ways to ensure consistency between applications.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Since menus need to be easily accessible to the user, you should try to keep your application's menu hierarchy as shallow as possible.&nbsp; In general, a menu should be located no more than two steps away from the main menu.&nbsp; It's even better to have menus no more than one step away, as long as they don't grow too long or confusing as a result.</font></td></tr>

<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0>

<tr valign=top>

<td width=106></td>

<td><font face="Times">A menu should never have fewer than two commands unless it grows and shrinks dynamically and happens to shrink to fewer than two.&nbsp; If an application has a menu with only one item in it, that item should be bumped up one level and replace the command that brings up the menu.&nbsp; (A specific example of this is discussed later in this chapter under &quot;The Info Menu.&quot;)</font>

<p><font face="Times">A menu can have as many submenus as it has commands, although only one at a time can be attached to the menu.&nbsp; A menu should appear only once in the menu hierarchy--it should not be the submenu of two menus.</font>

<p><br><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Choosing Command Names</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">Command names should be short, consisting of a single word if possible, a short phrase if not.&nbsp; Avoid abbreviations in commands, especially those that aren't standardized or widely used.&nbsp; Applications in the same language should follow the same capitalization rules.&nbsp; For English, commands are capitalized as they would be in a title--the first and last words begin with uppercase letters, as well as major words in between.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Each command name should be unique.&nbsp; No two commands, even if they're in different menus, should have the same name.</font>

<p><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Commands that Perform Actions</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">Wherever possible, the first word of an action command should be a verb, so the command reads like a short imperative sentence for the action it performs.&nbsp; Examples include Hide, Open, Save As, and Revert to Saved.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Some menu commands have different results, depending on the application's state.&nbsp; The name of such a command should change so that it always describes what the command will do.&nbsp; The clearest way to do this is to change the command's verb. Some examples of good names follow:</font></td></tr>

<td><font face="Times">Avoid using two menu commands instead of changing the menu command's name.&nbsp; For example, you shouldn't have a Show Ruler command followed by a Hide Ruler command, where one of the commands is always disabled.</font>

<p><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Commands that Bring Up Panels</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">With one exception, a command that always brings up a panel must have three dots&nbsp; immediately following its name (for example, &quot;Preferences...&quot;).&nbsp; The exception happens when the panel is a warning panel--such as one that comes up when the user tries to revert to a saved version of a document.&nbsp; Because the user could complete the action if the warning panel weren't there, it's inaccurate to imply that the command brings up a useful panel.&nbsp; Also, users who are new to an application sometimes tend to look at all of its panels (by choosing menu commands with &quot;...&quot;).&nbsp; You don't want to encourage users to choose commands that are so dangerous that they require warning panels.&nbsp; For example, the Workspace Manager Log Out command doesn't have three dots, even though it always brings up a warning panel.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Do <i>not</i> put three dots after commands that only bring up a standard window (like the New Viewer command in the Workspace Manager, or the New command in the standard Document menu).</font>

<p><font face="Helvetica"><b>Note:</b></font>&nbsp; <font face="Times">Use three periods (not the ellipsis character) to produce the three dots.</font>

<p><font face="Times">If the purpose of a command is to perform an action, and the panel comes up only to help complete the action, then the command should be named for the action, not for the panel.&nbsp; (The panel is then given a name that reflects the command name.)&nbsp; In this case, use the guidelines for naming described earlier in &quot;Commands that Perform Actions.&quot;&nbsp; For example, the standard Save, Save As, and Save To commands are action commands that happen to bring up a panel (which is called the Save panel).</font>

<p><font face="Times">If the purpose of the command is to bring up the panel, then the command is named after the panel.&nbsp; This usually results in a noun phrase as a name, instead of the verb phrase that's usually used for action commands.&nbsp; For example, the Preferences command brings up the Preferences panel, and the Spelling command brings up the Spelling panel.</font>

<p><font face="Times">A command that brings up a panel shouldn't usually have <i>Panel</i> in its name, since the three dots already indicate that it brings up a panel.&nbsp; However, you can add <i>Panel</i> if the command's name would otherwise be identical to another command's name.&nbsp; For example, when the command that brings up the Info panel is in the Info menu, the command is named Info Panel.&nbsp; When an application has no Info menu, the command is named just Info.</font>

<p><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Commands that Bring Up Submenus</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">Commands that bring up submenus usually begin with nouns, but verbs or adjectives are acceptable if they're clearer.&nbsp; Every submenu command in a menu should have a name that's clearly different from every other command in the menu, so that the user can guess what each submenu contains by its name.&nbsp; For example, it's a bad idea to have under the main menu both a Tools menu and a Utilities menu, since most users won't be able to remember which is which.</font>

<p><font face="Times">If a command brings up a menu of actions, it might be appropriate to have the command name the &quot;target&quot; of the actions.&nbsp; The Document menu uses this scheme:&nbsp; the Open command can be read as Open Document, the New command can be read as New Document, and so on.</font>

<p><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Commands that Bring Up Standard Windows</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">A command that brings up a standard window should either start with <i>New</i> (as in the standard New command described under &quot;The Document Menu,&quot; below) or match the title of the window.&nbsp; For example, the Workspace Manager has a New Viewer command under its View menu.</font>

<p><font face="Times">The Spelling command brings up the Spelling panel, which is described in Chapter 5.&nbsp; The Check Spelling command is equivalent to the button on the panel that searches for and selects the next misspelled word in the main window.&nbsp; It permits the user to find the next misspelled word without bringing up the panel.&nbsp; If the application can't find the next misspelled word until the user takes some action within the Spelling panel (for example, loads a dictionary), Check Spelling brings up the panel.&nbsp; (This is parallel behavior to Save bringing up a panel when the user must first supply a file name, or Find Next bringing up the Find panel if the user needs to enter a text string to search for.)</font>

<p><font face="Times">If an application has spelling options that can't be accommodated in a panel, Spelling and Check Spelling should be replaced by a Spelling command that brings up a submenu.&nbsp; That menu might then have Spelling Panel and Check Spelling commands.</font>
