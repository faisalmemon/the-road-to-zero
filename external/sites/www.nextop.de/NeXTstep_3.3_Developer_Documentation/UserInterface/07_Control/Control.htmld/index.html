<p><font face="Times">Every control responds visually to direct manipulation by the user--a dial turns, a button pushes in or highlights, the knob of a slider slides.&nbsp; Controls go beyond this direct response, however, to cause the application to do something.&nbsp; They, in effect, translate the user's direct manipulation into an instruction for the application.&nbsp; A button sets a state or initiates a program action, a slider sets a value, and so on.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Which keyboard and mouse actions a control responds to and how it reacts visually are part of the definition of the control; they're discussed in this chapter.&nbsp; What the control causes an application to do is part of the definition of the application; it depends solely on how the application uses the control.&nbsp; In this respect, graphical controls are no different from control devices in the real world.&nbsp; For example, identical mass-produced switches can be installed on a variety of different machines.&nbsp; The manufacturer of the switch provides it with a user interface; the installer gives it specific meaning for a specific machine.</font>

<td><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>How Buttons Work</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">The Application Kit provides two basic kinds of buttons:&nbsp; <i>one-state</i> (or <i>action</i>) buttons and <i>two-state</i> buttons.&nbsp; Action buttons perform a single task, such as scrolling a document forward or starting a search.&nbsp; A two-state button sets a single characteristic on or off, such as whether to restrict a search to whole words.&nbsp; Standard two-state buttons include switches and radio buttons. Some buttons also bring up lists, as described in the following section.</font>

<p><font face="Times">All buttons respond to a click.&nbsp; Some also respond to being pressed.&nbsp; A button that responds to being pressed sends an instruction to the application as soon as the user pushes the mouse button down.&nbsp; Typically, it repeats the instruction at regular intervals--as long as the mouse button is held down and the cursor is kept over the button on-screen--for a continuous, iterative action.&nbsp; Users can drag away from the button and back again to stop and restart the action.&nbsp; A button that responds only to being clicked sends its instruction to the application when the user releases the mouse button, provided the cursor is over the button on-screen.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Whether it responds to being clicked or to being pressed, a button changes its appearance as soon as the mouse button goes down.&nbsp; It retains its altered appearance while it's under the cursor and the mouse button remains down.&nbsp; When the user releases the mouse button, the button on-screen keeps its altered appearance long enough for its instruction to be carried out.&nbsp; Usually this is momentary (though it need not be), so users generally notice the button changing as soon as the click is over.</font>

<p><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Buttons that Bring Up Lists</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">The Application Kit has support for two kinds of button-list combinations:&nbsp; pop-up lists and pull-down lists.&nbsp; A pop-up or pull-down list is a window that comes to the screen when the user presses a button.&nbsp; The user can drag through the list to choose an option or action.&nbsp; The list stays on-screen only as long as the user keeps the mouse button down.&nbsp; Although pop-up lists and pull-down lists look similar, they have very different roles in the user interface.</font>

<p><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica"><b>Pop-Up Lists</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">Pop-up lists are used in lieu of a series of radio buttons.&nbsp; They save screen space and prevent overcrowding in panels.&nbsp; Each list is controlled by a button that can be recognized by a special symbol <img src="EPS4.gif" width=12 height=9 vspace=3>, as shown below.&nbsp; The label on the button that precedes the symbol indicates the current selection from the list.&nbsp; When the user makes a new selection, the button label changes.</font></td></tr>

<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0>

<tr valign=top>

<td width=106></td>

<td><font face="Times">Pressing the button pops the list up so that the item matching the button label appears on top of the button.&nbsp; The list remains up only while the user holds the mouse button down.&nbsp; When the user releases the mouse button after dragging to a different item in the list, the label on the button changes to that item.</font>

<p><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica"><b>Pull-Down Lists</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">Pull-down lists are similar to pop-up lists, but they're used to perform actions, rather than to set a state.&nbsp; In this respect, pull-down lists are somewhat like menus.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Visually, pull-down lists differ from pop-up lists in that the controlling button's label never changes, and it's marked by a different symbol <img src="EPS2.gif" width=8 height=7 vspace=3>.</font></td></tr>

<td><font face="Times">Of course, before using a button, you should be sure that it's the best control for the job.&nbsp; &quot;Choosing the Appropriate Control,&quot; at the end of this chapter, discusses which controls can be used for which types of functionality.</font>

<p><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Choosing the Button's Result</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">A one-state (action) button shouldn't change the action it performs.&nbsp; Although it's sometimes tempting to alter the action with the application's state--to switch between Erase and Restore, for example--it's best to provide a different button for each action and disable those that aren't operable.&nbsp; This lets the user safely click in the accustomed place without having to consider which state the application is in.&nbsp; However, it's acceptable for buttons that perform time-consuming actions to have a stop state, as described in &quot;Implementing Stop Buttons,&quot; later in this chapter.</font>

<p><font face="Times">One-state buttons are generally labeled with a verb or verb phrase (such as Find), but occasionally they have only a graphic image (such as the arrowhead in a scroll bar button).&nbsp; Labeling conventions are discussed in &quot;Choosing the Button's Image or Label,&quot; below.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Two-state buttons should never perform actions, although the characteristic they affect might result in some visible change.&nbsp; For example, an inspector for a graph might have a set of radio buttons that control the graph's type (line, bar, and so on).&nbsp; Clicking one of the buttons resets the graph's type, which in turn results in the graph being redrawn.&nbsp; However, it wouldn't be acceptable for the radio button to, for example, create a second graph of the new type.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Ideally, as soon as the user clicks a two-state button, the visible consequences (if any) should be shown immediately.&nbsp; However, that's not always practical, as when changing the characteristic takes a long time or isn't easy to reverse.&nbsp; For example, if changing the type of a graph takes a long time, then the application might wait for the user to click a Redraw Graph button before redrawing the graph.</font>

<p><font face="Times">However, whether or not a two-state button's associated characteristic changes immediately, the button's appearance always changes immediately, as described in &quot;Changing the Button's Appearance during a Click,&quot; later in this chapter.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Buttons with more than two states aren't recommended:&nbsp; It's very difficult to convey their result to the user.</font>

<p><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Choosing the Button's Image or Label</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">A button's label should say, in a succinct shorthand, what action it causes the application to take.&nbsp; Even when a button purports to label a state (such as AM or PM), users are apt to think of it not as the current state, but as the state that will be set if the button is clicked.&nbsp; In other words, they're liable to interpret it as an action.&nbsp; An On button, for example, is more likely to be interpreted to mean &quot;Press this to turn something on&quot; than &quot;This is now on.&quot;</font>

<p><font face="Times">It's best, therefore, to use images and highlighting to show the current state, and reserve the button's label as a brief statement of what the button does.&nbsp; Buttons that do label a state, such as a button that switches between AM and PM, should be used only where what they label is clearly visible.&nbsp; For example, AM/PM buttons can be used alongside a digital representation of the time, but they can't stand alone.&nbsp; These and other two-state buttons are shown in the figure in the following section.</font>

<p><font face="Helvetica"><b>Note:</b></font>&nbsp; <font face="Times">Make sure that the button clearly looks like either an action button or a two-state button.&nbsp; It's confusing to the user to see a two-state button that doesn't clearly have two states, or an action button that doesn't look like it performs an action.</font>

<p><font face="Times">You should always dim the label of a button (using gray text) whenever pushing the button will have no effect.&nbsp; A dimmed button is completely disabled--pushing it shouldn't cause it to highlight, push in, or change in any other way.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Button labels should be capitalized like menu commands:&nbsp; The first and last words begin with uppercase letters and the words between are capitalized as they would be in a title.&nbsp; Like menu commands, buttons that always bring up a panel (unless it's a warning panel) should have three dots (...) at the end of the label.</font>

<p><font face="Times">When an action button can be chosen using the Return key, the button should contain the Return symbol to the right of its label, as shown below at the left.&nbsp; However, when pressing Return won't choose the button--for example, when the button's window isn't the key window--the Return symbol should disappear from the button (as shown at the right, below).&nbsp; Removing the Return symbol helps avoid user confusion over whether pressing Return will work.</font></td></tr>

<p><font face="Helvetica"><b>Note:</b></font>&nbsp; <font face="Times">The Colors panel is an Application Kit panel discussed in Chapter 5, &quot;Panels.&quot;&nbsp; The Colors panel is brought up by the Colors command; it also appears whenever the user selects a color well's border.</font>

<p><font face="Times">One alternative to using a color well, when the group of acceptable colors is small, is to use graphical radio buttons (as pictured in the &quot;Buttons&quot; section earlier in this chapter).&nbsp; Another alternative, when a wide range of colors is needed, is to use the Colors panel alone.&nbsp; The user can change an object's color by selecting it and then choosing the new color in the Colors panel.&nbsp; You can also use a new, customized control if it's more appropriate in appearance and functionality than a color well.</font>

<p><font face="Times">To choose a color for a color well, the user drags a color either from the Colors panel or from another color well.&nbsp; Another way to set the color is to select the border of the color well.&nbsp; The well's color then changes every time a new color is chosen in the Colors panel.&nbsp; Because the user might not realize a border is selected, this scheme can be confusing.&nbsp; You should be careful to deselect the border whenever the user isn't likely to want to change the color.&nbsp; For example, you should make sure that color wells are deselected when their window is miniaturized.</font>

<p><font face="Times">When an object is selected, each visible color well should change its color to reflect the object's associated color.&nbsp; For example, if a white box with a red border is selected, then the Fill well shown in the previous figure should contain white, and the Line well should contain red.&nbsp; Once the user changes the color in a well, that change should be reflected in the selected object.&nbsp; For example, dragging a swatch of green from the Colors panel into the Line well should immediately make the outline of the selected box green.</font>

<p><font face="Times">The two scroll buttons on the same scroller form a related pair.&nbsp; When the user drags from one to the other without releasing the mouse button, each button acts as if it had been pressed.&nbsp; It's not possible to slide from the scroll buttons on one scroller to those on the other scroller, however.</font>

<p><font face="Times">When the Alternate key is held down, the scroll buttons scroll one viewful at a time.&nbsp; Generally, when scrolling down a document, the bottom line (or two) is redisplayed at the top of the opening each time the display changes.&nbsp; When scrolling toward the beginning of a document, the top line (or two) is redisplayed at the bottom.&nbsp; This provides users with a bit of overlapping context and reassures them that nothing was skipped over when the display changed.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Sometimes scroll buttons appear alone, without the rest of the scroller.&nbsp; Since the knob and bar aren't present to indicate when it's impossible to scroll further in one direction or the other, the arrow on a scroll button must be dimmed when the button won't work.</font></td></tr>

<p><br><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Controls that Start Actions</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">Actions should usually be started by either a menu command or a button.&nbsp; If necessary, you can even duplicate a menu command in a button.&nbsp; Even though text fields can start actions as the result of pressing Return, they should always have a button nearby that appears to be clicked when Return is pressed.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Sometimes an action is relatively unimportant, and having a button for it takes up too much screen space.&nbsp; If the action isn't appropriate for a menu command for some reason, then another choice is to make it an item in a pull-down list.</font>

<p><font face="Times">The following figure shows how the same action (printing) might appear as a menu command, button, and pull-down list item. (It normally appears as a menu command.)</font></td></tr>

<td><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Controls that Show State</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">Pop-up lists, selection lists, and two-state buttons are used to show state.&nbsp; (Menu commands should never be used to show state.)&nbsp; Sometimes a single control shows the state of a single option.&nbsp; Often, though, options are grouped.&nbsp; Such a group should have either a one-of-many relationship, where exactly one option is always selected, or an unrestricted relationship, where any number of options (or none at all) might be selected.</font>

<p><font face="Helvetica"><b>Note:</b></font>&nbsp; <font face="Times">A third relationship is currently possible only in selection lists:&nbsp; a relationship in which either no choice or one choice can be selected.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Controls that show state should be used strictly to show and set state, not to initiate actions.&nbsp; For example, although double-clicking an item in a selection list might cause an action to happen, the double-click is really a shortcut for selecting the item and then clicking a button.&nbsp; If setting state has visible consequences, such as causing the format of a document to change, then the consequences should merely be immediate feedback that the state has changed, and not a full action such as creating another document with the new format.</font>

<p><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Displaying a Single Option</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">Often options are grouped together.&nbsp; Sometimes, however, a single option stands alone.&nbsp; In this case, a switch is the preferred control.&nbsp; Another possibility is a graphical two-state button, as long as it's very clear that the button has two states.</font></td></tr>
