<td><font face="Times">One of the goals of the NEXTSTEP user interface is to provide a simple, graphical interface to the UNIX operating system. This is largely the responsibility of the Workspace Manager, the application that's brought to the screen after the user logs in. More specifically, the Workspace Manager provides a graphical interface to the file system.&nbsp; It's a substitute for a UNIX command interpreter (or shell) that locates files, displays folder contents, associates files with applications and icons, starts up applications, and keeps track of the user's home folder and working environment.&nbsp; It lets users manage files by manipulating their iconic representations.</font>

<p><font face="Times">For command-line interaction with the operating system, users can put up a window that emulates a VT-100 terminal and runs a standard shell.&nbsp; This window is provided by the Terminal application, which can be started up from the Workspace Manager.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Terminal is documented in the <i>NEXTSTEP Development Tools and Techniques</i> manual.&nbsp; The Workspace Manager is documented in the <i>User's Guide</i>.</font></td></tr>

<td><font face="Times">The NEXTSTEP file system is arranged very much like a traditional UNIX file system.&nbsp; However, by default, when users view the file system in the Workspace Manager, they won't see many of the traditional UNIX folders.&nbsp; Instead, they'll see only a small number of folders that organize the tools and information they most need.&nbsp; Under the root (/) folder, they'll find the following folders:</font></td></tr>

<td><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Home Folders</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">In the list above, the folder labeled <i>user</i> stands for the user's home folder.&nbsp; The home folders of other users may also be visible. As is traditional, home folders bear the name of the user--the name that the user logs in under.&nbsp; By default, the user's name is <b>me</b>, and the home folder is <b>/me</b>.</font>

<p><font face="Times">If a machine is connected to a file server over a network, users' home folders are likely to be located somewhere on the file server.&nbsp; The figure above simply illustrates the default location for a home folder and where it would be located if it were on the startup disk.&nbsp; Home folders on remote machines are accessed through the <b>Net</b> folder described below.</font>

<p><font face="Times">When typing in a file name, users can specify their home folder as <b>~</b>.&nbsp; For example, <b>~/Apps</b> refers to the <b>Apps</b> folder that's in the home folder of the current user.</font>

<p><br><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>NeXT Folders</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">Four of the top-level folders begin with a &quot;Next&quot; prefix--<b>NextApps</b>, <b>NextAdmin</b>, <b>NextDeveloper</b>, and <b>NextLibrary</b>.&nbsp; They contain documents, resources, and applications that are bundled with the computer.</font>

<p><font face="Times">The <b>NextApps</b> folder contains supported applications for NEXTSTEP users.&nbsp; In it are general-interest applications like Edit, Preferences, Mail, and PrintManager.</font>

<p><font face="Times">The <b>NextAdmin</b> folder also contains supported applications, but ones that will be used mainly by system administrators and network managers.&nbsp; They're not for general users like those in <b>NextApps</b>.</font>

<p><font face="Times">The main purpose of the <b>NextDeveloper</b> folder is to provide applications and files that are necessary for developing NEXTSTEP applications.&nbsp; Some of the folders that can appear in <b>NextDeveloper</b> include:</font></td></tr>

Command-line debuggers and profiling tools are in standard UNIX folders such as <b>/bin</b> and <b>/usr/bin</b>.</font></td></tr>

<td width=106></td>

<td><font face="Times">The <b>NextLibrary</b> folder contains resource files organized into several folders.&nbsp; Some of the files and folders aren't on every system.&nbsp; Typical folders include <b>/NextLibrary/Documentation</b>, which holds NEXTSTEP technical documentation, and <b>/NextLibrary/Fonts</b>, which holds the PostScript fonts available to all applications.</font>

<p><br><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Local and Personal Folders</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">The four folders with a &quot;Next&quot; prefix can be matched by four identical folders with a &quot;Local&quot; prefix.&nbsp; Internally, these four folders should be organized like their &quot;Next&quot; counterparts.&nbsp; But instead of containing files supplied by NeXT, they should hold information and applications provided for all users at a local site.&nbsp; Any user who logs in to a machine, or boots from it over a network, has access to its &quot;Local&quot; folders.&nbsp; If you add a new font for all users of your network, for example, it would reside in <b>/LocalLibrary/Fonts</b>.</font>

<p><font face="Times">&quot;Local&quot; folders are created as they're needed.&nbsp; They aren't included on the release disk.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Users can add unprefixed <b>Library</b> and <b>Apps</b> folders in their home folders to hold information and applications that they alone have access to.&nbsp; Users who develop utilities for their own use or purchase private copies of a word processor and spreadsheet, for example, should put them in <b>~/Apps</b>.</font>

<p><br><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Net</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">The <b>Net</b> folder gives the user access to file systems that are physically located on remote machines.&nbsp; The immediate folders under <b>Net</b> name the machines where the file systems are located.&nbsp; The next level of folders name the root folders of the file systems on those machines.&nbsp; For example, <b>/Net/willow/misc</b> is where the <b>misc</b> file system located on the <b>willow</b> computer would be mounted.</font>

<p><font face="Times"><b>Net</b> contains folders only if the user's computer is set up to be connected to other machines over a network.</font>

<p><font face="Times">All the folders in the root (<b>/</b>) folder, including <b>Net</b>, are physically located on the disk that the user's machine was booted from. If a user boots from a local hard disk, for example, <b>NextLibrary</b> and all its folders will be stored on the local disk.&nbsp; Remote folders are mounted only under <b>Net</b>.</font>

<p><br><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Paths</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">The Workspace Manager searches for executable files by using a <i>search path</i>, an ordered set of folders.&nbsp; The default path used by the Workspace Manager lists these six folders:</font></td></tr>

<p>

<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0>

<tr valign=top>

<td width=106></td>

<td><font face="Times">Before using the search path to find which application to start up, the Workspace Manager first looks in the dock.&nbsp; Each application icon in the dock represents a particular application residing in a particular folder on disk.&nbsp; By putting an icon in the dock, the user has indicated a preference for that version of the application over any others.</font>

<p><font face="Times">If an application isn't in the dock, the Workspace Manager looks next in the current working folder, the folder containing the file the user wants to open.&nbsp; Only after failing to find the application there does it turn to the path listed above.</font>

<p><font face="Times">In the path, the Workspace Manager looks first in the <b>Apps</b> folder of the current user's home folder.&nbsp; That's where the user's own applications would be.&nbsp; It next looks in the <b>/LocalApps</b> folder for sitewide software, then in the <b>/NextApps</b>, <b>/NextDeveloper/Apps</b>, <b>/NextAdmin</b>, and <b>/NextDeveloper/Demos</b> folders for NeXT-supplied software.&nbsp; This ordering of folders lets users customize their software to override sitewide software, and lets sitewide software override software supplied by NeXT.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Users can alter the path shown above for the Workspace Manager by setting a value for the ApplicationPaths parameter in their defaults database.&nbsp; You might do this, for example, to add a <b>/LocalAdmin</b> or <b>/LocalDeveloper/Apps</b> folder to the path.</font>

<p><br><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>File Name Extensions</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">NEXTSTEP applications use file name extensions to identify types of files.&nbsp; The extension consists of the last period in the file name and all characters following it.&nbsp; For example, Mail uses the &quot;.mbox&quot; file name extension to identify its mailboxes.&nbsp; Typical mailbox names are <b>Active.mbox</b> and <b>Outgoing.mbox</b>.</font>

<p><font face="Times">The Workspace Manager uses file name extensions not only to identify particular types of files, but also to associate document files with applications.&nbsp; Every application that defines its own data file format appends an identifying extension to the names of its document files.</font>

<p><br><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>File Packages</b></font>

<p><font face="Times">A <i>file package</i> is a folder that the Workspace Manager presents to users as if it were a file.&nbsp; Because users normally don't look inside a file package (unless they explicitly open it as a folder), they're not likely to alter or reorganize its contents.&nbsp; &quot;Using File Packages,&quot; later in this chapter, describes when you should use file packages.</font></td></tr>

<td><font face="Times">An application should create a file package when it has a group of files that it needs to keep together.&nbsp; For example, if your application displays information that's stored in independent text files, or if it makes use of a private utility program, or if it just loads archived objects from Interface Builder &quot;.nib&quot; files, you may want to keep these auxiliary files in close proximity to the application executable file.&nbsp; A file package (with the &quot;.app&quot; file name extension) is the way to do it.</font>

<p><font face="Times">Similarly, if your application creates documents that are split into more than one file--for example, if text is in one file and artwork in another--these files can also be grouped in a file package.</font>

<p><font face="Times">File packages for documents should bear the same extension that's assigned to the application's document files.&nbsp; For example, if a word processor uses a file package to store a document that has artwork, then the file package's extension should be the same as if the document had no artwork and was thus in a single file.</font>
