Description:
Ever wanted to get into the Security Research game?  Want to climb the Mount Everest of challenges, the iOS platform?

When fishing in the pond of iOS vulnerabilities, this book will tell you how to catch the fish.

Because security knowledge of platforms is so valuable, the learning path is shrouded in darkness.  We shine a light here!

The attackers already have their craft.  This book opens the door for all software engineers working on iOS and other critical software infrastructure to be more able to defend against threats by sharing the thought process of attackers.

Does this book have actual vulnerabilities, so-called Zero Days, which are known to the underground but not reported to the vendors?  The answer is no!  We give tools and insights here.  Instead, we equip you for your mountain ascent.
