# The Hammer

When studying past exploits it can feel like your brain has been hit by a hammer.  It is because most exploit discussions work on the basis that you have had an apprenticeship on all the underlying techniques, and that only that final layer needs explanation.

This approach is understandable from the writer's perspective.  If you are a researcher you will naturally seek out underlying technologies, documentation and reading materials as part of your research journey.  The writer's audience will be such researchers.  So the writer will not dwell on the supporting techniques and technologies.

Since iOS and macOS use many niche technologies, or use standard techniques with some Apple ecosystem unique twists, it is not so easy to do your background reading.

In this chapter we shall look at an exploit write-up.  Our purpose is not to understand the exploit as such, but to survey the techniques and technologies at play.  It will provide us the motivation to explore such items in subsequent chapters knowing that this knowledge will then help us circle back and understand the originally presented exploit.
