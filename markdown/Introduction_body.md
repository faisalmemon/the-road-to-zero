TBC, write this introduction.

To complement the book, there is a website of resources which is intended to be used alongside the printed material so example projects can be setup and run by yourself and experimented with.  All references in this book are collected into the Bibliography Chapter at the end of the book.  There you will find URLs to resources, for example.

The GitHub website supporting the book is at @trtzgithub
