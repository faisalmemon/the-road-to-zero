#Introduction

This is a book about Zero Day Vulnerabilities.

It is called "The Road to Zero" because it is primarily a tutorial guide to take you along the path needed to find your own vulnerabilities.

The focus of our book is iOS.  In fact, when we talk about iOS we often mean the family of Operating Systems from Apple that are based around the same underpinnings.  It would be more accurate to say this book focusses on Darwin, the common UNIX and NeXT technology stack from which macOS, iOS, tvOS, and watchOS are derived.

Likewise when we refer to a device, we say iDevice because there are lots of different Apple produced products in different device classes, such as various models of iPhone, iPod or iPad.
