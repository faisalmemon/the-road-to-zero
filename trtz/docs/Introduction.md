#Introduction

This web-based book is about Zero Day Vulnerabilities.

It is called "The Road to Zero" because it is primarily a tutorial guide to take you along the path needed to find your own vulnerabilities.

The focus of our book is iOS.  In fact, when we talk about iOS we often mean the family of Operating Systems from Apple that are based around the same underpinnings.  It would be more accurate to say this book focusses on Darwin, the common UNIX and NeXT technology stack from which macOS, iOS, tvOS, and watchOS are derived.

Likewise when we refer to a device, we say iDevice because there are lots of different Apple produced products in different device classes, such as various models of iPhone, iPod or iPad.

There will be a companion Udemy course to accompany the book.  Hopefully this will accomodate different learning styles.  The book is better for drilling into subtle details, but the videos are better to getting a sense of the interactive and exploratory aspects of vulnerability hunting.  The book will remain cost free, and the Udemy course will be at a reasonable cost.
