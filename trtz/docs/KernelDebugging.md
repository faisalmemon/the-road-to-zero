# Kernel Debugging

There is a good textbook on the Darwin family of Operating Systems; see @newosxbook.  In this chapter however, we aim for a practical hands-on approach, and defer theory until later on our journey.

Discovering 0-days is mostly a practical exercise, accompanied by a knowledge of strategy, a bedrock of theory, and a toolchain of reverse engineering tools.

In the same way that beginner programmers, particularly from an academic training, try to design and architect their system before starting to code (and thus missing information and hitting knowledge gaps), beginner hackers try to read everything about the target system before cracking them.  Hacking is mostly a journey of discovery just like software engineering.  Only trivial, or previously well practiced systems are ameniable to big up-front design approaches.  Also, knowing less about a system can sometimes be advantageous because new avenues are tried or novel approaches are discovered.
